    "abstract": "The siting of a radioactive waste disposal facility involves site survey, site selection and site confirmation. Throughout the siting process a series of calculations and data analyses are performed with increasing complexity as increasing amounts and more detailed data becomes available. Each one of these stages requires a multidisciplinary approach to evaluate the most important aspects that affect the performance and safety of the disposal facility. The evaluation of these aspects has uncertainties that are related to the complex interactions amongst a large number of parameters, lack of data, and ignorance as to natural processes. Simplifications are used to reduce the size and complexity of the computational model and this also causes uncertainty in the validity of the predicted performance. Due to lack of data and ignorance of the exact physical processes that are involved, linguistic expressions are used to describe natural processes. Expressions such as \u201cstrongly fractured rock\u201d or \u201clow U content\u201d are very powerful in the sense that they can carry robust information that has an important impact on decision-making. Therefore, a mathematical representation of these expressions would be an important tool for the analyst to effectively use this linguistic information. This paper presents some applications of the fuzzy logic tools to address the epistemic uncertainty throughout the stages of the disposal facility implementation.",

    "abstract": "A proper labeling of a graph is an assignment of integers to some elements of a graph, which may be the vertices, the edges, or both of them, such that we obtain a proper vertex coloring via the labeling subject to some conditions. The problem of proper labeling offers many variants and received a great interest during recent years. We consider the algorithmic complexity of some variants of the proper labeling problems, we present some polynomial time algorithms and NP-completeness results for them.",

We consider the full range of saturated to completely unsaturated media. In the case of the lowest order Raviart--Thomas spaces and the range of all possible saturations, we bound the H-1-norm of the error in capacity in terms of approximation error. This estimate uses a time-integrated scheme and the Kirchhoff transformation to handle a degeneracy in the case of completely unsaturated flow. Optimal convergence is then shown for a nonlinear form related to the error in the capacity for the case of saturated to partially saturated flow. Convergence rates depending on the Holder continuity of the capacity term are derived. Last, optimal convergence of pressures and fluxes is stated for the case of strictly partially saturated flow.",

In this work, MAHAOS devices (SONOS-like structures with high k stack gate dielectric) were studied regarding the first known characterization of the ionization radiation sensing response. The change of threshold voltage VT for a MAHAOS device after gamma ray exposure had a strong correlation to the total ionization dose (TID) of gamma radiation up to at least 5 Mrad TID. In this paper, the gamma radiation response performances of the pre-programmed and virgin (non-pre-programmed) MAHAOS devices are presented. The experimental data show that the change of VT for the pre-programmed MAHAOS device with gamma irradiation is very significant. The data of pre-programmed MAHAOS devices written by 5 Mrad TID of gamma radiation was also stable for a long time with data storage. The sensing of gamma radiation by pre-programmed MAHAOS devices with high k stack gate dielectric reported in this study has demonstrated their potential application for non-volatile ionizing radiation sensing technology in the future.",

    "abstract": "This paper considers the problem of subcarrier scheduling in the downlink of multicell OFDMA networks. It proposes a dynamic fractional frequency reuse cell architecture that partitions subcarriers into two groups. One is reused in the whole cell area whereas the other is partitioned into sectors and used orthogonally. The proposed architecture allows dynamic allocation of users to the group of subcarriers. This dynamic allocation of users is different from the existing architectures where users are partitioned according to fixed thresholds. Next, we propose an efficient hierarchical solution which first allocates subcarriers to the groups and next opportunistically schedules subcarriers to the users. The overall scheme allows frequency reuse factor of 1 with reduced inter-cell interference, increased trunking gain and satisfied minimum data rate requirements. Simulation results illustrate the usefulness of the proposed solution.",

    "abstract": "Pricing of derivatives is one of the central problems in computational finance. Since the theory of derivative pricing is highly mathematical, numerical techniques such as lattice approach, finite-difference and finite-element among others have been employed. Recently fast Fourier transform (FFT) has been employed for derivative pricing in sequential computers. In this paper, we report development of a multithreaded FFT pricing algorithm and performance evaluation on a multithreaded platform. The focus of this study is on the effectiveness of using a parallel computer for financial problems and performance evaluation of a multithreaded algorithm for finance applications such as derivative pricing. In general, a parallel algorithm for FFT, with blocked data distribution of N elements on P processors, involves communication for log P iterations and terminates after log N iterations. The first (log N \u2212 log P) iterations therefore, require no communication and a sequential algorithm can be used in each processor. We call this a local algorithm. At the end of the (log N \u2212 log P) iterations, the processors switch to a multithreaded algorithm where sending and receiving of threads is through message passing. We call this a remote algorithm. The algorithm has been implemented on the EARTH (Efficient Architecture for Running THreads) multithreaded platform. Our results indicate that the FFT multithreaded algorithm for option pricing is very efficient giving a relative speedup of 50% on 64 processors. This study reveals an important commercial application for High Performance Computing.",

The proposed scheduler is further developed in the consideration of the case that network might become unfeasible, where extra weight functions are introduced into the proportional fair (PF) scheduler so that the proposed extra weight function provides more resources to users who are easier to achieve the target throughput than those who cannot. It does not guarantee target throughput for all users but eventually increases the number of users being served with the guaranteed minimum throughput. It is investigated for the proposed schedulers and other conventional ones how large the throughput is and how many users are guaranteed the target throughput. Simulation results show that the proposed algorithms have 10 to 20 % more users being served with the minimum guaranteed throughput. The trade-off between the throughput guarantee level and sector throughput is shown in the proposed schedulers.",

    "abstract": "We have identified a novel wireless covert timing channel (WCTC) that could be used by malware to exfiltrate data from mobile devices. We introduce the WCTC by demonstrating its ability to transmit data covertly: (1) across existing network services, (2) across ICMP pings, and (3) via a trojanized chat application. The WCTC is implemented by manipulating the Android operating system's CPU on the client end to modulate network traffic emitted from the mobile device by purposely adjusting the CPU's speed to send a binary 1 or 0. The data is recovered and deciphered on the receiving end by applying a simple threshold to the average inter-packet spacing of a fixed number of packets within a bit stream sent by the client. To our knowledge, there only exists intrusive methods to defeat this type of channel. We characterize this potential threat by determining: (1) its channel capacity, (2) the accuracy of its data transmission, (3) the effects of network hops on its accuracy, and (4) the minimum mobile device signal strength required to maintain 90% or better message recovery.",

Due to a great number of bug reports submitted into the bug repository, the workload of the triagers who are responsible for arranging developers to fix the given bugs is very high. In order to reduce the triagers' workload, a number of approaches (e.g., machine learning algorithms and social network metrics) were proposed to study who should fix the bug report. In this study, we propose a novel algorithm for developer recommendation. We first introduce a component and a similar bug-based selection process to verify the candidate fixers, then by adopting the number of comments and commits, we construct a multi-developer network so that ranking these candidates for finding the most appropriate fixer to resolve the given bug. In order to evaluate our work, we measured the effectiveness of our approach based on 3,008 bug reports from the JBoss Issue bug repository. We also compared the proposed approach to three previous studies. The result shows that our approach performs the task of bug triage effectively.",

It was found that in majority of cases LSF inter-frame ordering property takes place. On this basis a new approach to LSF calculation is proposed. The LSF localization is mainly reduced to verification of inter-frame ordering property. The computational expenses are reduced in 3.4 times in comparison with widely used Kabal's method. Besides, the maximum number of operations is lower than the minimum expenses of accelerated Kabal's method. The method was implemented on fixed-point DSP and showed stable performance.",

    "abstract": "Data mining in electronic medical records may facilitate clinical research, but much of the structured data may be miscoded, incomplete, or non-specific. The exploitation of narrative data using natural language processing may help, although nesting, varying granularity, and repetition remain challenges. In a study of community-acquired pneumonia using electronic records, these issues led to poor classification. Limiting queries to accurate, complete records led to vastly reduced, possibly biased samples. We exploited knowledge latent in the electronic records to improve classification. A similarity metric was used to cluster cases. We defined discordance as the degree to which cases within a cluster give different answers for some query that addresses a classification task of interest. Cases with higher discordance are more likely to be incorrectly classified, and can be reviewed manually to adjust the classification, improve the query, or estimate the likely accuracy of the query. In a study of pneumonia-in which the ICD9-CM coding was found to be very poor-the discordance measure was statistically significantly correlated with classification correctness (.45; 95% CI .15-.62).",

    "abstract": "Evaluation of post-stroke hemiplegic patients is an important aspect of rehabilitation, especially for assessing improvement of a patient's condition from a treatment. It is also commonly used to evaluate stroke patients during theraputic clinical trials [1]. The Fugl-Meyer Assessment is one of the most widely recognized and utilized measures of body function impairment for post-stroke patients [2]. We propose a method for automating the upper-limb portion of the Fugl-Meyer Assessment by gathering data from sensors monitoring the patient. Features are extracted from the data and processed by a Support Vector Machine (SVM). The output from the SVM returns a value that can be used to score a patient's upper limb functionality. This system will enable automatic and inexpensive stroke patient evaluation that can save up to 30 minutes per patient for a doctor, providing a huge time-saving service for doctors and stroke researchers.",

    "abstract": "We present an integrated and multidisciplinary approach for analyzing the behavior of moving objects. The results originate from an ongoing research of four different partners from the Dutch Poseidon project (Embedded Systems Institute (2007)), which aims to develop new methods for Maritime Safety and Security (MSS) systems to monitor vessel traffic in coastal areas. Our architecture enables an operator to visually test hypotheses about vessels with time-dependent sensor data and on-demand external knowledge. The system includes the following components: abstraction and simulation of trajectory sensor data, fusion of multiple heterogenous data sources, reasoning, and visual analysis of the combined data sources. We start by extracting segments of consistent movement from simulated or real-world trajectory data, which we store as instances of the Simple Event Model (SEM), an event ontology represented in the Resource Description Framework (RDF). Next, we add data from the web about vessels and geography to enrich the sensor data. This additional information is integrated with the representation of the vessels (actors) and places in SEM. The enriched trajectory data are stored in a knowledge base, which can be further annotated by reasoning and is queried by a visual analytics tool to search for spatiotemporal patterns. Although our approach is dedicated to MSS systems, we expect it to be useful in other domains.",

The execution of a program now entails the complex interaction of code, compiler and processor architecture. The current generation of microprocessors is optimized to an existing set of commercial and scientific benchmarks but new applications such as data mining are becoming a significant part of the workload. In this paper we explore the use of performance monitoring hardware to analyze the execution of C4.5, a data mining application, on the IBM Power2 architecture. We see how the data gathered by the hardware can be used to identify potential changes that can be made to the program and the processor micro-architecture to improve performance. We then go on to evaluate changes to C4.5 and to the micro-architecture. Based on our experience, we identify issues that limit the use of performance monitoring hardware in user level tuning and in extending its use to high performance computing environments.",

    "abstract": "Global telecommunication services create an enormous volume of real time data. Long distance voice networks, for example, can complete more than 250 million calls a day; wide area data networks can support many hundreds of thousands of virtual circuits and millions of Internet protocol (IP) flows and Web server sessions. Unlike terabyte databases, which typically contain images or multimedia streams, telecommunication databases mainly contain numerous small records describing transactions and network status events. The data processing involved therefore differs markedly, both in the number of records and the data items interpreted. To efficiently configure and operate these networks, as well as manage performance and reliability for the user, these vast data sets must be understandable. Increasingly, visualization proves key to achieving this goal. AT&T Infolab is an interdisciplinary project created in 1996 to explore how software, data management and analysis, and visualization can combine to attack information problems involving large scale networks. The data Infolab collects daily reaches tens of gigabytes. The Infolab project Swift-3D uses interactive 3D maps with statistical widgets, topology diagrams, and pixel oriented displays to abstract network data and let users interact with it. We have implemented a full scale Swift-3D prototype, which generated the examples presented.",

    "abstract": "We study the synthesis problem in an asynchronous distributed setting: a finite set of processes interact locally with an uncontrollable environment and communicate with each other by sending signals --- actions that are immediately received by the target process. The synthesis problem is to come up with a local strategy for each process such that the resulting behaviours of the system meet a given specification. We consider  external  specifications over  partial orders  . External means that specifications only relate input and output actions from and to the environment and not signals exchanged by processes. We also ask for some closure properties of the specification. We present this new setting for studying the distributed synthesis problem, and give decidability results: the non-distributed case, and the subclass of networks where communication happens through a strongly connected graph. We believe that this framework for distributed synthesis yields decidability results for many more architectures.",

    "abstract": "Defect density and variabilities in values of parameters continue to grow with each new generation of nano-scale fabrication technology. In SRAMs, variabilities reduce yield and necessitate extensive interventions, such as the use of increasing numbers of spares to achieve acceptable yield. For most microprocessor chips, the number of SRAM bits is expected to grow 2\u00d7 for every generation. Consequently, microprocessor chip yields will be seriously undermined if no defect-tolerance approach is used. In this paper, we show the limits of the traditional spares-based defect-tolerance approaches for SRAMs. We then propose and implement a software-based approach for improving cache yield. We demonstrate that our approach can significantly increase microprocessor chip yields (normalized with respect to chip area) compared to the traditional approaches, for upcoming fabrication technologies. In particular, we demonstrate that our approach dramatically increases effective computing capacity, measured in MIPS-per-unit-chip-area. Our approach does not require any hardware design changes and hence can be applied to improve yield of any modern microprocessor chip, incurs low performance penalty only for the chips with unrepaired defects in SRAMs, and adapts without requiring any design changes as the yield improves for a particular design and fabrication technology.",

    "abstract": "A class-constrained resource allocation problem is considered. In this problem, a set of  M  heterogeneous resources is to be allocated optimally among a set of  L  users belonging to  K  user classes. A set of class allocation constraints, which limit the number of users of a given class that could be allocated to a given resource, is imposed. An algorithm with worst case time complexity  O(M (LM + M 2  + LK))  is presented along with a proof of its correctness. This problem arises in many areas of resource management in computer systems, such as load balancing in distributed systems, transaction processing in distributed database systems, and session allocation in time-shared computer systems. We illustrate the behavior of this algorithm with an example where file servers are to be allocated to workstations of multiple classes.",

    "abstract": "Parallel corpora encode extremely valuable linguistic knowledge, the revealing of which is facilitated by the recent advances in multilingual corpus linguistics. The linguistic decisions made by the human translators in order to faithfully convey the meaning of the source text can be traced and used as evidence on linguistic facts which, in a monolingual context, might be unavailable to (or overlooked by) a computer program. Multilingual technologies, which to a large extent are language independent, provide a powerful support for systematic and consistent cross-lingual studies and allow for easier building of annotated linguistic resources for languages where such resources are scarce or missing. In this paper we will briefly present some underlying multilingual technologies and methodologies we developed for exploiting parallel corpora and we will discuss their relevance for crosslinguistic studies and applications.",

    "abstract": "UML has been widely accepted by the software community for several years. As electronic systems design can no longer be seen as an isolated hardware design activity, UML becomes of significant interest as a unification language for systems description combining both HW and SW components. This article provides a comprehensive view of the UML applied to System-on-Chip (SoC) and hardware-related embedded systems design. The modeling concepts in the UML language are first introduced, including major diagrams for the representation of the behavior and the structure of systems. The principles behind application specific UML customizations (UML profiles) are summarized, and several examples relevant for SoC design are given, such as the SysML (System Modeling Language) and the SoC Profile. Thereafter, various approaches associating UML with existing HW/SW design languages are presented. Beyond language aspects, the article addresses the question of UML-based design flows, and shows how UML can be applied concretely to the development of electronic-based systems. The current situation about tool support constitutes the last focus of the article. In particular, we show how UML tools can be combined with well-known simulation environments, such as MATLAB.",

Typically, data quality assessment consists of calculating a synthesizing value by means of a weighted average of values and weights associated with each data quality dimension of the data quality model. We shall study not only the overall perception of the level of importance for the set of users carrying out similar tasks, but also the different issues that can influence the selection of the data quality dimensions for the model. The core contribution of this paper is a framework for representing and managing data quality models using social networks. The framework includes a proposal for a data model for social networks centered on data quality (DQSN), and an extensible set of operators based on soft-computing theories for corresponding operations.",

    "abstract": "Horizontal mechanisms are structural overlays (such as roles and groups) and non-structural devices (such as physical co-location) that are designed to facilitate cross-unit collaboration. The objective of this study is to increase our cumulative knowledge about what top-down mechanisms are being used to promote the coordination of IS activities across corporate/division boundaries. Propositions about how mechanism usage differs under Centralized versus Federal IS organization contexts are developed based on a synthesis of prior organization science and empirical IS literature. Multiple methods are used to collect data from IS and non-IS senior managers from two case sites with theoretically different IS coordination needs. As predicted, multiple types of structural and non-structural mechanisms were implemented for business-IS coordination in the company with a Centralized IS context, and for corporate IS-decentralized IS coordination in the company with a Federal IS context. An unexpected finding was that mechanisms for both of these kinds of IS coordination were valued at each case site. The prediction that a formal group mechanism would be perceived as more effective for achieving cross-unit coordination than an integrator role mechanism was not supported. The article concludes with a discussion of implications for research and practice.",

    "abstract": "A lot of research has been done within the area of mobile computing and context-awareness over the last 15 years, and the idea of systems adapting to their context has produced promising results for overcoming some of the challenges of user interaction with mobile devices within various specialized domains. However, today it is still the case that only a limited body of theoretically grounded knowledge exists that can explain the relationship between users, mobile system user interfaces, and their context. Lack of such knowledge limits our ability to elevate learning from the mobile systems we develop and study from a concrete to an abstract level. Consequently, the research field is impeded in its ability to leap forward and is limited to incremental steps from one design to the next. Addressing the problem of this void, this article contributes to the body of knowledge about mobile interaction design by promoting a theoretical approach for describing and understanding the relationship between user interface representations and user context. Specifically, we promote the concept of indexicality derived from semiotics as an analytical concept that can be used to describe and understand a design. We illustrate the value of the indexicality concept through an analysis of empirical data from evaluations of three prototype systems in use. Based on our analytical and empirical work we promote the view that users interpret information in a mobile computer user interface through creation of meaningful indexical signs based on the ensemble of context and system.",

The advantages of a hybrid knowledge-based system are described followed by the system objectives, means of control, and constraints. A framework is provided that describes the necessary development stages of a commercial knowledge-based package. An overview of the utility knowledge acquisition procedure is provided to appreciate the complexity of defining the rule base. This is followed by a description of the flow of information in a three-level hierarchical rule base and a summary of network radiality, parameter. and performance rules employed in this rule base. After a heuristic preprocessor identifies a list of switch closures that would seem to reduce total system losses, network radiality rules assess if a particular search path has identified a switch that can be closed and a corresponding switch opened to maintain the radiality of the system or if the path is worth pursuing further. Network parameter rules ensure the system operates within original design parameters. Network performance rules assess the reduction in total system losses of each proposed switching operation. Where there is a coupling between knowledge-based and numerical methods, the integration of numerical methods is described. Finally, the validation and simulations as well as the benefits of this hybrid knowledge-based system are described.",

    "abstract": "There have been increases in the elderly population worldwide, and this has been accompanied by rapid growth in the health-care market, as there is an ongoing need to monitor the health of individuals. Wireless body area networks (WBANs) consist of wireless sensors attached on or inside the human body to monitor vital health-related problems, e.g., electrocardiograms (ECGs), electroencephalograms (EEGs), and electronystagmograms (ENGs). With WBANs, patients' vital signs are recorded by each sensor and sent to a coordinator. However, because of obstructions bythe human body, sensors cannot always send the data to the coordinator, requiring them to transmit at higher power. Therefore, we need to consider the lifetime of the sensors given their required transmit power. In the IEEE 802.15.6 standard, the transmission topology functions as a one-hop star plus one topology. In order to obtain a high throughput, we reduce the transmit power of the sensors and maintain equity for all sensors. We propose the multiple-hop transmission for WBANs based on the IEEE 802.15.6 carrier-sense multiple-access with collision avoidance (CSMA/CA) protocol. We calculate the throughput and variance of the transmit power by performing simulations, and we discuss the results obtained using the proposed theorems.",

    "abstract": "Advances in digital technologies have led to an increasing concern about piracy for providers of digital content (e.g., e-books, games, music, software, videos). Yet controversies exist over the influence of copyright protection on firm profitability. The objective of this paper is to provide an alternative rationale for the growing anti-protection trend and to investigate optimal copyright enforcement and quality provision in a monopoly setting. The proposed economic mechanism centers on the influence of copyright protection on consumer search when consumers can get to know the firm\u2019s actions (e.g., price, quality) only after costly search. We show that more stringent copyright protection can induce the consumers to rationally expect lower ex post surplus, thus exerting a negative strategic effect on the consumers' willingness to search. This strategic effect may outweigh the positive main effect on the relative attractiveness of the authorized versus the pirated product, which can hence explain the optimality of incomplete and even zero copyright protection policies in markets where consumer prepurchase search is important (e.g., information goods, digital products). It is also because of this strategic effect that the firm may provide lower quality as copyright enforcement increases. Interestingly, quality unobservability can moderate this strategic effect and thus lead to an increasing incentive for copyright protection. This paper was accepted by Pradeep Chintagunta, marketing.",

    "abstract": "Many tasks in AI require representation and manipulation of complex functions. First-Order Decision Diagrams (FODD) are a compact knowledge representation expressing functions over relational structures. They represent numerical functions that, when constrained to the Boolean range, use only existential quantification. Previous work has developed a set of operations for composition and for removing redundancies in FODDs, thus keeping them compact, and showed how to successfully employ FODDs for solving large-scale stochastic planning problems through the formalism of relational Markov decision processes (RMDP). In this paper, we introduce several new ideas enhancing the applicability of FODDs. More specifically, we first introduce Generalized FODDs (GFODD) and composition operations for them, generalizing FODDs to arbitrary quantification. Second, we develop a novel approach for reducing (G)FODDs using model checking. This yields - for the first time - a reduction that maximally reduces the diagram for the FODD case and provides a sound reduction procedure for GFODDs. Finally we show how GFODDs can be used in principle to solve RMDPs with arbitrary quantification, and develop a complete solution for the case where the reward function is specified using an arbitrary number of existential quantifiers followed by an arbitrary number of universal quantifiers.",

    "abstract": "We present the modelling of embedded systems with SimBed, an execution-driven simulation testbed that measures the execution behavior and power consumption of embedded applications and RTOSs by executing them on an accurate architectural model of a microcontroller with simulated real-time stimuli. We briefly describe the simulation environment and present a study that compares three RTOSs: /spl mu/C/OS-II, a popular public-domain embedded real-time operating system; Echidna, a sophisticated, industrial-strength (commercial) RTOS; and NOS, a bare-bones multirate task scheduler reminiscent of typical \"roll-your-own\" RTOSs found in many commercial embedded systems. The microcontroller simulated in this study is the Motorola M-CORE processor: a low-power, 32-bit CPU core with 16-bit instructions, running at 20MHz. Our simulations show what happens when RTOSs are pushed beyond their limits and they depict situations in which unexpected interrupts or unaccounted-for task invocations disrupt timing, even when the CPU is lightly loaded. In general, there appears no clear winner in timing accuracy between preemptive systems and cooperative systems. The power-consumption measurements show that RTOS overhead is a factor of two to four higher than it needs to be, compared to the energy consumption of the minimal scheduler. In addition, poorly designed idle loops can cause the system to double its energy consumption-energy that could be saved by a simple hardware sleep mechanism.",

Both disturbance rejection and compensation of load changes must be possible. In this paper, a classical Clarke-Gawthrop type controller is compared to a new structure where a feedforward compensation of the load is added. The adaptive implementation of this controller is also studied. Practical problems such as non-zero steady-state error and control windup in presence of constraints on the manipulated variable are also solved. Real-time operation records show that this control structure is very satisfying.",

    "abstract": "We have proposed diffusion flow control (DFC) as a technique for controlling a network, using an analogy of the diffusion phenomenon. In DFC, although each node in a network handles its local traffic flow only on the basis of the information it is aware of, the diffusion effect of DFC distributes the packet density in a network, so avoiding packet loss. In our previous work, we have assumed that each node knows the lengths of the links adjacent to it and we used control timing depending on the link length. In this paper, we describe an extension of the DFC in which the control timing is independent of the link length so allowing DFC to be used in a mobile ad hoc network.",

    "abstract": "While many algorithms for speaker or environment adaptation have been proposed, far less attention has been paid to approaches which address both factors. We recently proposed a method called factored adaptation that can jointly compensate for speaker and environmental mismatch using a cascade of CMLLR transforms that separately compensate for the environment and speaker variability. Performing adaptation in this manner enables a speaker transform estimated in one environment to be be applied when the same user is in different environments. While this algorithm performed well, it relied on knowledge of the operating environment in both training and test. In this paper, we show how unsupervised environment clustering can be used to eliminate this requirement. The improved factored adaptation algorithm achieves relative improvements of 10\u201318% over conventional CMLLR when applying speaker transforms across environments without needing any additional a priori knowledge.",

    "abstract": "Deploying minimum sensors to construct a wireless sensor network such that critical areas in a sensing field can be fully covered has received much attention recently. In previous studies, a sensing field is divided into square grids, and the sensors can be deployed only in the center of the grids. However, in reality, it is more practical to deploy sensors in any position in a sensing field. Moreover, the number of sensors may be limited due to a limited budget. This motivates us to study the problem of using limited sensors to construct a wireless sensor network such that the total weight of the covered critical square grids is maximized, termed the weighted-critical-square-grid coverage problem, where the critical grids are weighted by their importance. A reduction, which transforms our problem into a graph problem, termed the constrained node-weighted Steiner tree problem, is proposed and used to solve our problem. In addition, three heuristics, including the greedy algorithm (GA), the group-based algorithm (GBA), and the profit-based algorithm (PBA), are proposed for the constrained node-weighted Steiner tree problem. Simulation results show that the proposed reduction with the PBA provides better performance than the others.",

    "abstract": "Data security is well-recognized a vital issue in an information system that is supported in an outsource environment. However, most of conventional XML encryption proposals treat confidential parts of an XML document as whole blocks of text and apply encryption algorithms directly on them. As a result, queries involving the encrypted part cannot be efficiently processed. In order to address these problems, we propose XQEnc, a novel approach to support querying encrypted XML. XQEnc is based on two important techniques of vectorization and skeleton compression. Essentially, vectorization, which is a generalization of columns of a relational table, makes use the basic path of an XML tree to label the data values. Skeleton compression collapses the redundant paths into a multiplicity attribute. Our analysis and experimental study shows that XQEnc achieves both better query efficiency and more robust security compared with conventional methods. As an application, we show how XQEnc can be realized with relational techniques to enable secure XML data outsourcing.",

    "abstract": "The rapid growth of wireless LAN (WLAN) deployments will bring about many novel mobile applications. Among them will be real-time multimedia streaming applications running on UDP, which may interfere with current data applications running on TCP. This paper is a first attempt to investigate how to ensure the performance of these two groups of applications when they co-exist over a WLAN. Toward this end, we have designed and implemented a UDP rate adaptation scheme called adaptive-buffer rate control (ABRC) for multimedia streaming over WLAN. ABRC has two distinguishing features compared with other schemes: 1) it can achieve arbitrary bandwidth allocations between UDP and TCP in the WLAN, as opposed Io previously proposed \"TCP friendly\" schemes, which can only achieve uniform bandwidth allocations; and 2) the majority of previously proposed flexible bandwidth-allocation schemes achieve arbitrary bandwidth allocations by prioritizing and scheduling packet transmissions within network equipment (i.e., within routers, base stations, etc.). In contrast, ABRC is an end-to-end application-layer solution that does not require changes to current WLAN products, making it more readily deployable over existing networks.",

Up to 2011, there have been an urban population of 691 million, and emerged several mega-city regions, such as Beijing, Shanghai, and Hong Kong-Shenzhen-Guangzhou etc. For the significant, large-scale economy and population cluster effect, mega-city regions have become important engines for promoting economic growth and social development. With the hyperactive urban construction, overwhelming urban scale and rapid population growth, there occurs more and more urban geological problems in land utilization, resource supply, environmental protection, hazards prevention and cure in many cities, which become big threats to urban geological safety and constraints on the urban sustainable development. For all cities are constructed on geological objects, the support of Urban Geology is necessary for urban development, and urban geological information has irreplaceable basic role for rapid development of mega-city regions. There is an increasing requirement for the intellectualized, integrated, multi-dimensional and quick-response geological safety supporting system for mega-city regions (GSSSMR) based on the technologies of large spatial databases, GIS, virtual reality and networks, etc., meeting the need of guaranteeing geological resources and geological environment safety, and urban planning, construction, management, mitigating and preventing disasters, etc. After analyzing the requirements of geological information and GSSSMR, we introduce the architecture of GSSSMR. At last, based on the research in this paper, the development and applications of GSSSMR in Beijing, China are presented.",

MOA is designed to deal with the challenging problems of scaling up the implementation of state of the art algorithms to real world dataset sizes and of making algorithms comparable in benchmark streaming settings. It contains a collection of offline and online algorithms for classification, clustering and graph mining as well as tools for evaluation. For researchers the framework yields insights into advantages and disadvantages of different approaches and allows for the creation of benchmark streaming data sets through stored, shared and repeatable settings for the data feeds. Practitioners can use the framework to easily compare algorithms and apply them to real world data sets and settings. MOA supports bi-directional interaction with WEKA, the Waikato Environment for Knowledge Analysis. Besides providing algorithms and measures for evaluation and comparison, MOA is easily extensible with new contributions and allows for the creation of benchmark scenarios.",

The objective of the proposed cross-layer resource allocation is formulated into a constrained optimization problem, which incorporates the three layers into an integrated framework. To solve the problem effectively, we propose an elitist selection adaptive genetic algorithm (ESAGA), in which the probabilities of crossover and mutation are varied depending on the diversity of population. Numerical examples demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed algorithm. Due to its low computational complexity, our proposed algorithm is very suitable for implementation in a practical system.",

Unlike other state-of-the-art computing platforms, such as General Purpose Processors (GPPs) and General Purpose Graphics Processing Units (GPGPU), FPGAs can moreover exploit the applications' requirements with respect to the employed number representation scheme, with the potential to lead to considerable area savings and throughput increases. This work proposes a novel FPGA based architecture for Monte Carlo simulations that monitors and configures the number representation of the system during run-time in order to accommodate the dynamics of the system under investigation, resulting to a considerable boost on the overall performance of the system compared to a conventional system. In order to evaluate the efficacy of the proposed architecture, the GARCH model from the financial industry is considered as a case study. The results demonstrate that an average of ~1.35x throughput per resource unit improvement is achieved compared to conventional parallel arithmetic implementation.",

    "abstract": "Activated sludge process is a widely used method to treat domestic and industrial effluents. The con- ditions of activated sludge wastewater treatment plant (AS-WWTP) are related to the morphological properties of flocs (microbial aggregates) and filaments, and are required to be monitored for normal operation of the plant. Image processing and analysis is a potential time-efficient monitoring tool for AS-WWTPs. Local adaptive seg- mentation algorithms are proposed for bright-field microscopic images of activated sludge flocs. Two basic modules are suggested for Otsu thresholding-based local adaptive algorithms with irregular illumination com- pensation. The performance of the algorithms has been compared with state-of-the-art local adaptive algorithms of Sauvola, Bradley, Feng, and c-mean. The comparisons are done using a number of region- and nonregion- based metrics at different microscopic magnifications and quantification of flocs. The performance metrics show that the proposed algorithms performed better and, in some cases, were comparable to the state-of the-art algo- rithms. The performance metrics were also assessed subjectively for their suitability for segmentations of acti- vated sludge images. The region-based metrics such as false negative ratio, sensitivity, and negative predictive value gave inconsistent results as compared to other segmentation assessment metrics. \u00a9 2015 SPIE and IS&T (DOI: 10.1117/1.JEI.24.6.061102)",

In this paper, we compare the performance of linear subspace methods which involve the computation of scatter matrices for face recognition under illumination variation. The performance of these methods is evaluated in terms of classification accuracy, computational training and testing time. Extensive empirical experiments are performed to compare the performance using AR, Pie, Yale and YaleB face databases. In absence of sufficient number of training samples, classification accuracy of linear subspace methods deteriorate. Experimental results show that the performance of Dual LDA is best in terms of average classification accuracy. It is also observed that Fisherface takes minimum training time and both ERE and SVM takes minimum testing time. No linear subspace method outperforms others in terms of all performance measures.",

    "abstract": "In pervasive computing environments, information gateways derive specific information, such as a person's location, from raw data provided by a service, such as a videostream offered by a camera. Here, access control to confidential raw data provided by a service becomes difficult when a client does not have access rights to this data. For example, a client might have access to a person's location information, but not to the videostream from which a gateway derives this information. Simply granting access rights to a gateway will allow an intruder into the gateway to access any raw data that the gateway can access. We present the concept of derivation-constrained access control, which requires a gateway to prove to a service that the gateway needs requested raw data to answer a client's authorized request for derived information. Therefore, an intruder into the gateway will be limited in its capabilities. We provide a formal framework for derivation-constrained access control based on Lampson et al.'s \u201cspeaks-for\u201d relationship. We demonstrate feasibility of our design with a sample implementation and a performance evaluation.",

Resolving such heterogeneity depends on accurate estimation of fractions of alleles that harbor somatic mutations.

This review provides a general framework within which GCMRD research can be integrated, evaluated, and guided. GCMRDs (or \"moving windows\") are analyzed in terms of (a) the nature of their images (i.e., \"multiresolution,\" \"variable resolution,\" \"space variant,\" or \"level of detail\"), and (b) the movement of the A01 (i.e., \"gaze contingent,\" \"foveated,\" or \"eye slaved\"). We also synthesize the known human factors research on GCMRDs and point out important questions for future research and development.

The rigorous size and mass constraints infer various problems related to energy efficiency, flight stability and overall system design. In this research, aerodynamics and flight dynamics are investigated experimentally to gather information for the design of the helicopter's propulsion group and steering system. Several test benches are designed and built for these investigations. A coaxial rotor test bench is used to measure the thrust and drag torque of different rotor blade designs. The effects of cyclic pitching of the swash plate and the passive stabilizer bar are studied on a test bench measuring rotor forces and moments with a 6---axis force sensor. The gathered knowledge is used to design a first prototype of the muFly helicopter. The prototype is described in terms of rotor configuration, structure, actuator and sensor selection according to the project demands, and a first version of the helicopter is shown. As a safety measure for the flight tests and to analyze the helicopter dynamics, a 6DoF vehicle test bench for tethered helicopter flight is used.",

In open and complicated underwater environments, targets (events) tend to be highly dynamic and uncertain. It is important to deploy sensors to cover potential events in an optimal manner. In this paper, the underwater sensor deployment problem and its performance evaluation metrics are introduced. Furthermore, a particle swarm inspired sensor self-deployment algorithm is presented. By simulating the flying behavior of particles and introducing crowd control, the proposed algorithm can drive sensors to cover almost all the events, and make the distribution of sensors match that of events. Through extensive simulations, we demonstrate that it can solve the underwater sensor deployment problem effectively, with fast convergence rate, and amiable to distributed implementation.",

    "abstract": "The representation used by a learning algorithm introduces a bias which is more or less well-suited to any given learning problem. It is well known that, across all possible problems, one algorithm is no better than any other. Accordingly, the traditional approach in machine learning is to choose an appropriate representation making use of some domain-specific knowledge, and this representation is then used exclusively during the learning process.To reduce reliance on domain-knowledge and its appropriate use it would be desirable for the learning algorithm to select its own representation for the problem.We investigate this with XCS, a Michigan-style Learning Classifier System.We begin with an analysis of two representations from the literature: hyperplanes and hyperspheres. We then apply XCS with either one or the other representation to two Boolean functions, the well-known multiplexer function and a function defined by hyperspheres, and confirm that planes are better suited to the multiplexer and spheres to the sphere-based function.Finally, we allow both representations to compete within XCS, which learns the most appropriate representation for problem thanks to the pressure against overlapping rules which its niche GA supplies. The result is an ecology in which the representations are species.",

It allows operating on data without revealing its content. In this work, we suggest using homomorphism for Hardware Trojan protection. We implement two partial homomorphic designs based on El Gamal encryption/decryption scheme. The first design is a multiplicative homomorphic, whereas the second one is an additive homomorphic. We implement the proposed designs on a low-cost Xilinx Spartan-6 FPGA. Area utilization, delay, and power consumption are reported for both designs. Furthermore, we introduce a dual-circuit design that combines the two earlier designs using resource sharing in order to have minimum area cost. Experimental results show that our dual-circuit design saves 35% of the logic resources compared to a regular design without resource sharing. The saving in power consumption is 20%, whereas the number of cycles needed remains almost the same.",

Although OSA is a contemporary research topic, little attention has been given to the capacity analysis under quality-of-service (QoS) constraints. Hence, we use the effective capacity, which is a powerful tool to analyze the QoS requirements in wireless communication systems, to study the sustainable packet arrival rate of the secondary users while meeting statistical QoS constraints. We derive the effective capacity region of the two-user OSA system and propose a method to obtain the capacity region boundary. In addition, by combining the finite state channel model and the activity of the primary user, an extended finite state channel model for the two-user OSA system is also proposed.",

    "abstract": "What does it take to possess a concept? Behaviour of various degrees of complexity is based on different levels of cognitive abilities. Concept possession ranges between mere stimulus-response schemes and fully developed propositional representations. Both biological and artifical systems can be described in terms of these levels of cognitive abilities, and thus we can meaningfully ask whether a given system has concepts. We regard that question not in terms of behavioural criteria, but from a formal point of view. We focus on the interrelation between a given objective structure of concepts and a subject's representation of that structure. The main question is how much of the structure of the objective side needs to be mirrored subjectively in order to grant possession of concepts. Our approach shows a strong parallel to epistemic logic. There, the objective side can be represented by an algebra of true propositions, and an epistemic subject can represent some of these propositions as what she believes to be true. As in propositional epistemic logic, in an epistemic logic of concepts the main issue is finding adequate closure conditions on the subjective set of representations. We argue that the appropriate closure conditions can be stated formally as closure under witnesses for two types of relationships among concepts: in order for a subject to possess a concept c she has to represent both a sibling and a cousin of c. We thus arrive at a first formally perspicious candidate for a psychologically adequate epistemic logic of concepts.",

    "abstract": "In this paper, we study the problem of mining high confidence fragment-based classification rules from the imbalanced HIV data whose class distribution is extremely skewed. We propose an efficient approach to mining frequent fragments in different classes of compounds that can provide best hints of the characteristic of each class and can be used to build associative classification rules. We adopt the pattern-growth paradigm and define an efficient fragment enumeration scheme. Moreover, we introduce an improved instance-centric rule-generation strategy to mine the high-confidence fragment-based classification rules, which are very insightful and useful in differentiating one class from other classes. Experiments show that our algorithm can discover more interesting rules than the previous method and can facilitate the detection of new compounds with desired anti-HIV activity.",

    "abstract": "We give a comprehensive, market-flavoured look at the networks of electric vehicles (EVs) and their components: vehicles, charging stations, and coalitions of stations. We start by separately studying (i) how autonomously operated charging stations form coalitions; (ii) the price policy enacted by such coalitions; (iii) how vehicles select the charging station to use, pursuing a time/price trade-off. Then, we propose a model in which individual stations, coalitions of stations and vehicles interact in reaching a market equilibrium. We also address the issue of computational complexity, showing that, through our model, equilibria can be found in polynomial time. We evaluate our model in a realistic scenario, focusing on its ability to capture the consequences of the availability of an ITS system supporting the EV drivers, and to mimick the anticompetitive behavior that charging stations are likely to follow.",

Nonasymptotic case (finite length of blocks transmitted between parties) is also presented. Some examples are given to demonstrate that these protocols are in fact reliable and information-theoretically secure. We also discuss the problem - how to extend (2 1)-OT protocol to (L 1)-OT protocol and how to arrange BSC connecting parties.

Among those systems, flow-based detection systems which use a series of packets exchanged between two terminals as a unit of observation, have an advantage of being able to detect anomaly which is included in only some specific sessions. However, in large-scale networks where a large number of communications takes place, analyzing every flow is not practical. On the other hand, a timeslot-based detection systems need not to prepare a number of buffers although it is difficult to specify anomaly communications. In this paper, we propose a multi-stage anomaly detection system which is combination of timeslot-based and flow-based detectors. The proposed system can reduce the number of flows which need to be subjected to flow-based analysis but yet exhibits high detection accuracy. Through experiments using data set, we present the effectiveness of the proposed method.",

    "abstract": "Neuronal power attenuation or enhancement in specific frequency bands over the sensorimotor cortex, called Event-Related Desynchronization (ERD) or Event-Related Synchronization (ERS), respectively, is a major phenomenon in brain activities involved in imaginary movement of body parts. However, it is known that the nature of motor imagery-related electroencephalogram (EEG) signals is non-stationary and highly variable over time and frequency. In this paper, we propose a novel method of finding a discriminative time- and frequency-dependent spatial filter, which we call 'non-homogeneous filter.' We adaptively select bases of spatial filters over time and frequency. By taking both temporal and spectral features of EEGs in finding a spatial filter into account it is beneficial to be able to consider non-stationarity of EEG signals. In order to consider changes of ERD/ERS patterns over the time-frequency domain, we devise a spectrally and temporally weighted classification method via statistical analysis. Our experimental results on the BCI Competition IV dataset II-a and BCI Competition II dataset IV clearly presented the effectiveness of the proposed method outperforming other competing methods in the literature.",

Removing the synchronization constraint has the potential of speeding up the computation, while maintaining greater computation flexibility (e.g. differences in processors speed; differences in the data input to processors). We construct asynchronous (AS) finite difference schemes for the solution of PDEs by removing the synchronization constraint. We analyze the numerical properties of these schemes. Based on the analysis, we develop corrected-asynchronous (CA) finite difference schemes which are specifically constructed for an asynchronous processing. We present asynchronous (AS) and corrected-asynchronous (CA) finite difference schemes for the multi-dimensional heat equation.

    "abstract": "This paper studies the use of decomposition techniques to quickly find high-quality solutions to large-scale vehicle routing problems with time windows. It considers an adaptive decomposition scheme which iteratively decouples a routing problem based on the current solution. Earlier work considered vehicle-based decompositions that partitions the vehicles across the subproblems. The subproblems can then be optimized independently and merged easily. This paper argues that vehicle-based decompositions, although very effective on various problem classes also have limitations. In particular, they do not accommodate temporal decompositions and may produce spatial decompositions that are not focused enough. This paper then proposes customer-based decompositions which generalize vehicle-based decouplings and allows for focused spatial and temporal decompositions. Experimental results on class R2 of the extended Solomon benchmarks demonstrates the benefits of the customer-based adaptive decomposition scheme and its spatial, temporal, and hybrid instantiations. In particular, they show that customer-based decompositions bring significant benefits over large neighborhood search in contrast to vehicle-based decompositions.",

    "abstract": "Multivariate data analysis by artificial neural network (ANN) approach was carried out in a previous work to identify anomalous regime in a gas turbine operational data. In this work, statistical hypothesis analysis using univariate time series exhaust temperature data from the same engine model has been carried out. The objective is to compare the results of these two methods. The applicability and consistency of parametric t-test and nonparametric rank sum tests are first assessed considering different sample sizes with respect to two typical realistic data sets. This builds up confidence in the approach. The anomaly measure tends to increase sharply with sample size. Anomalous regime in the data are identified by both hypothesis tests with high anomaly measures as found by ANN technique.",

    "abstract": "SUMMARY This paper seeks to improve power-performance efficiency of embedded systems by the use of dynamic reconfiguration. Programmable logic devices (PLDs) have the competence to optimize the power consumption by the use of partial and/or dynamic reconfiguration. It is a non-exclusive approach, which can use other power-reduction techniques simultaneous, and thus it is applicable to a myriad of systems. The power-performance improvement by dynamic reconfiguration was evaluated through an augmented reality system that translates Japanese into English. It is a wearable and mobile system with a head-mounted display (HMD). In the system, the computing core detects a Japanese word from an input video frame and the translated term will be output to the HMD. It includes various image processing approaches such as pattern recognition and object tracking, and these functions run sequentially. The system does not need to prepare all functions simultaneously, which provides a function by reconfiguration only when it is needed. In other words, by dynamic reconfiguration, the spatiotemporal module-based pipeline can introduce the reduction of its circuit amount and power consumption compared to the naive approach. The approach achieved marked improvements; the computational speed was the same but the power consumption was reduced to around 1 .",

    "abstract": "Drowsiness of driver while driving is one major factor of traffic accident. Therefore, there are many researches to prevent and detect drowsy driving. Recent researches have focused on motion detection using cameras to determine drowsy driving. However, we have focused on non-invasive and inexpensive drowsiness detection system. In our previous research, we suggested a system based on the driver's head movement using infrared sensors. In this paper, we suggest another non-invasive and inexpensive system based on the driver's pulse wave by photoplethysmography (PPG) signal processing. Firstly, the system collects a pulse wave from a PPG sensor on a steering wheel and then it processes the signal to analyze driver's state. In order to evaluate the effectiveness of a human pulse wave for drowsiness detection, we integrated two systems. The experimental result using new integration system showed 83 percent drowsy driving detection rate in the state of real driving.",

    "abstract": "Stressful interpersonal experiences can be difficult to prepare for. Virtual humans may be leveraged to allow learners to safely gain exposure to stressful interpersonal experiences. In this paper we present a between-subjects study exploring how the presence of a virtual human affected learners while practicing a stressful interpersonal experience. Twenty-six fourth-year medical students practiced performing a prostate exam on a prostate exam simulator. Participants in the experimental condition examined a simulator augmented with a virtual human. Other participants examined a standard unaugmented simulator. Participants reactions were assessed using self-reported, behavioral, and physiological metrics. Participants who examined the virtual human experienced significantly more stress, measured via skin conductance. Participants stress was correlated with previous experience performing real prostate exams; participants who had performed more real prostate exams were more likely to experience stress while examining the virtual human. Participants who examined the virtual human showed signs of greater engagement; non-stressed participants performed better prostate exams while stressed participants treated the virtual human more realistically. Results indicated that stress evoked by virtual humans is linked to similar previous real-world stressful experiences, implying that learners real-world experience must be taken into account when using virtual humans to prepare them for stressful interpersonal experiences.",

The purpose of this effort is to try to suppress the undesirable effect of the noise found in the magnetic resonance imaging receiving antenna. This technique convolves the sampled real and imaginary signals taken directly from the antenna quadrature detector with a transfer function which is expressed in terms of the power spectrum of the measured signal with noise and the measured power spectrum of the noise, alone.

    "abstract": "Cancers in head and neck tends to spread to nearby lymph nodes. Lymph nodes trap the spreading tumor cells but then the tumor starts to grow in these nodes and then spread further. Our project is aimed to (1) predict the secondary regions of lymph nodes where a given primary tumor can metastasize, and (2) to generalize a pattern for lymph nodes metastasis of head and neck cancer by using artificial neural networks (ANN). The raw data for the analysis is provided by Dr. Lincoln Gray, Acta Otolaryngologica 2000, of 130 cases of pathologically-positive oral squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) from UK. Seven primary sites for tumors are identified: 1) buccal mucosa, 2) tongue, 3) retromolar trigone, 4) floor of mouth, 5) ventral tongue, 6) oropharynx, 7) lower alveolus. Ten secondary regions of lymph nodes metastasis are observed: five regions each on the same/opposite side (ipsilateral/contralateral) as the primary tumor site. In our oral squamous cell carcinoma study using ANN, we explore data analysis approach with two ANN methods: (1) a supervised multilayer feed forward back propagation (back-prop) method, and (2) an unsupervised self organizing map (SOM) method. This experience provides insight into implementation of ANN and directions to future investigation. The results from back-prop are comparable to that using multidimensional scaling (MDS) with respect to prediction of lymph nodes that have highest percentage of being metastasized, while SOM requires further work to identify clustering for individual primary cancer as well as next level of lymph node metastases.",

    "abstract": "The Post Randomization Method (PRAM) is a disclosure avoidance method, where values of categorical variables are perturbed via some known probability mechanism, and only the perturbed data are released thus raising issues regarding disclosure risk and data utility. In this paper, we develop and implement a number of EM algorithms to obtain unbiased estimates of the logistic regression model with data subject to PRAM, and thus effectively account for the effects of PRAM and preserve data utility. Three different cases are considered: (1) covariates subject to PRAM, (2) response variable subject to PRAM, and (3) both covariates and response variables subject to PRAM. The proposed techniques improve on current methodology by increasing the applicability of PRAM to a wider range of products and could be extended to other type of generalized linear models. The effects of the level of perturbation and sample size on the estimates are evaluated, and relevant standard error estimates are developed and reported.",

    "abstract": "In this paper, a new concept of a payoff-switching differential game is introduced. In this new game, any one player at any time may have several choices of payoffs for the future. Moreover, the payoff-switching process, including the time of payoff switching and the outcome payoff, of any one player is unknown to the other. Indeed, the overall payoff, which is a sequence of several payoffs, is unknown until the game ends. An algorithm for determining a reasoning strategy based on fuzzy reasoning is proposed. In this algorithm, the fuzzy theory is used to estimate the behavior of one player during a past time interval. By deriving two fuzzy matrices GSM, game similarity matrix, and VGSM, variation of GSM, the behavior of the player can be quantified. Two weighting vectors are selected to weight the relative importance of the player's behavior at each past time instant. Finally a simple fuzzy inference rule is adopted to generate a linear reasoning strategy. The advantage of this algorithm is that it provides a flexible way for differential game specialists to convert their knowledge into a \"reasonable\" strategy. A practical example of guarding three territories is given to illustrate our main ideas.",

    "abstract": "Antenna requirements for software defined radio (SDR) and cognitive radio (CR) systems are reviewed and the resulting challenges are discussed. Both concepts imply capabilities for operation over very wide bandwidths, of the order of one decade in some cases. This then becomes the main challenge for antenna designers. However, as the concepts evolve, some systems will work over limited bandwidths and existing or extended bandwidth antennas will be used. In the Paper the concepts are explained. As bandwidth is a major concern, the fundamental limits of performance are restated. For handheld radio antenna bandwidth and efficiency at low frequencies is the main problem. Both in the terrestrial fixed infrastructure and in space communication the difficulty of designing very wideband arrays to give the pattern control necessary for interference minimization is significant. In defence applications external handset antennas are seen to be necessary and extension to very wide bandwidths is also seen to be challenging. It is concluded that there is steady progress towards the realization of both SDR and CR, and this is throwing up very significant antenna challenges.",

    "abstract": "Today's health care is difficult to imagine without the possibility to objectively measure various physiological parameters related to patients' symptoms (from temperature through blood pressure to complex tomographic procedures). Psychiatric care remains a notable exception that heavily relies on patient interviews and self-assessment. This is due to the fact that mental illnesses manifest themselves mainly in the way patients behave throughout their daily life and, until recently there were no \u201cbehavior measurement devices.\u201d This is now changing with the progress in wearable activity recognition and sensor enabled smartphones. In this paper, we introduce a system, which, based on smartphone-sensing is able to recognize depressive and manic states and detect state changes of patients suffering from bipolar disorder. Drawing upon a real-life dataset of ten patients, recorded over a time period of 12 weeks (in total over 800 days of data tracing 17 state changes) by four different sensing modalities, we could extract features corresponding to all disease-relevant aspects in behavior. Using these features, we gain recognition accuracies of 76% by fusing all sensor modalities and state change detection precision and recall of over 97%. This paper furthermore outlines the applicability of this system in the physician\u2013patient relations in order to facilitate the life and treatment of bipolar patients.",

    "abstract": "The notion of digital fundamental group was originated by Khalimsky [E. Khalimsky, Motion, deformation, and homotopy in finite spaces, Proc. IEEE Int. Conf. Syst. Man Cybernet. (1987) 227-234]. Motivated by this notion, three kinds of digital k-homotopies as well as the relative k-homotopy were established [R. Ayala, E. Dominguez, A.R. Frances, A. Quintero, Homotopy in digital spaces, Discrete Appl. Math. 125 (1) (2003) 3-24; L. Boxer, A classical construction for the digital fundamental group, J. Math. Imaging Vis. 10 (1999) 51-62; S.E. Han, Connected sum of digital closed surfaces, Inform. Sci. 176 (3) (2006a) 332-348; T.Y. Kong, A digital fundamental group, Comput. Graphics 13 (1989) 159-166; R. Malgouyres, Homotopy in 2-dimensional digital images, Theor. Comput. Sci. 230 (2000) 221-233]. These four notions contributed to the development of three kinds of k-fundamental groups of a digital image (X,k). One was established by Kong [Kong, 1989] and Malgouyres [Malgouyres, 2000], and we denote by @p\"K\"M^k(X) this digital fundamental group. Another was developed by Boxer [Boxer, 1999] and extended by Han [Han, 2006a; S.E. Han, Discrete Homotopy of a closed k-surface, LNCS 4040, Springer-Verlag, Berlin, 2006b, pp. 214-225; S.E. Han, Equivalent (k\"0,k\"1)-covering and generalized digital lifting, Inform. Sci. 178 (2) (2008) 550-561] by using both the k-homotopic thinning [Han, 2006b; S.E. Han, Remarks on digital k-homotopy equivalence, Honam Math. J. 29 (1) (2007) 101-118] and Han's digital covering theory [S.E. Han, Digital coverings and their applications, J. Appl. Math. Comput. 18 (1-2) (2005) 487-495; Han, 2006b], which is denoted as @p\"B\"H^k(X) in this paper. The other was established by Ayala et al. by using the framework of a multilevel architecture [Ayala, 2003]. Since each of these digital k-fundamental groups has an intrinsic feature of its own and its usages depend on the situation. This study is focused on the first two notions, @p\"K\"M^k(X) and @p\"B\"H^k(X), and intended to show the strong merits of @p\"B\"H^k(X) in relation to the classification of digital images.",

    "abstract": "Three levels of virtual environment (VE) metric are proposed, based on: (1) users' task performance (time taken, distance traveled, and number of errors made), (2) physical behavior (locomotion, looking around, and time and error classification), and (3) decision making (i.e., cognitive) rationale (think aloud, interview, and questionnaire). Examples of the use of these metrics are drawn from a detailed review of research into VE wayfinding. A case study from research into the fidelity that is required for efficient VE wayfinding is presented, showing the unsuitability in some circumstances of common metrics of task performance such as time and distance, and the benefits to be gained by making fine-grained analyses of users' behavior. Taken as a whole, the paper highlights the range of techniques that have been successfully used to evaluate wayfinding and explains in detail how some of these techniques may be applied.",

Botnet has become a popular and productive tool behind many cyber attacks. Recently, the owners of some botnets, such as storm worm, torpig and conflicker, are employing fluxing techniques to evade detection. Therefore, the understanding of their fluxing tricks is critical to the success of defending from botnet attacks. Motivated by this, we survey the latest botnet attacks and defenses in this paper. We begin with introducing the principles of fast fluxing (FF) and domain fluxing (DF), and explain how these techniques were employed by botnet owners to fly under the radar. Furthermore, we investigate the state-of-art research on fluxing detection. We also compare and evaluate those fluxing detection methods by multiple criteria. Finally, we discuss future directions on fighting against botnet based attacks.",

We focus on applications that are either regular, predictable or at least do not require fine-grained dynamic replication of irregularly accessed data. Within this class, we use programs with a range of important communication patterns. We examine whether the basic parallel algorithm and communication structuring approaches needed for best performance are similar or different among the models, whether some models have substantial performance advantages over others as problem size and number of processors change, what the sources of these performance differences are, where the programs spend their time, and whether substantial improvements can be obtained by modifying either the application programming interfaces or the implementations of the programming models on this type of tightly-coupled multiprocessor platform.",

    "abstract": "Canny Edge Detector is the most widely used operator for edge detection. The problem with Canny is that it outputs a binary edge map, where an edge pixel (edgel) is marked (e.g., its value in the edge map is 255) and a non-edge pixel is unmarked (e.g., its value in the edge map is 0). A typical binary edge map is of low quality, consisting of gaps, notch-like structures, ragged and multi-pixel wide edgels. To clean up Canny's binary edge maps, fill up one pixel-wide gaps between the edgels, and to return the map as a set of edge segments, each of which is a one-pixel wide, contiguous chain of pixels, we employ the Smart Routing (SR) algorithm from our recently proposed Edge Segment Detection Algorithm, the Edge Drawing (ED). The proposed algorithm, called Canny Smart Routing (CannySR), runs Canny to obtain a binary edge map, and uses the Canny edgels as anchors for SR to convert them to edge segments. The produced edge segments can then be used in many applications such as line, arc, circle, ellipse, corner detection and other similar higher level object detection applications. We qualitatively evaluate the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm on some sample images and conclude that CannySR visibly improves the modal quality of Canny's binary edge maps although ED seems to produce the best results.",

    "abstract": "Understanding data semantics from real-life databases is considered following an audit perspective: it must help experts to analyse what properties actually hold in the data and support the comparison with desired properties. This is a typical problem of knowledge discovery in databases (KDD) and it is specified within the framework of Mannila and Toivonen where data mining consists in querying theories e.g., the theories of approximate inclusion dependencies. This formalization enables us to identify an important subtask to support database audit as well as a generic algorithm. Next, we consider the DREAM relational database reverse engineering method and DREAM heuristics are revisited within this new setting.",

We relate this qualitative modal logic to the many-valued analogues MVS5 and MVKD45 of the well known modal logics of knowledge and belief S5 and KD45 respectively.

The architecture of LITREF uses an inverted file structure with a bitmap strategy. The evaluation process uses the cosine function to measure the similarity between a query and an abstract. The Salton interpolation process is used in the computation of recall and precision values. The experiment involves applying alternative suffixing algorithms to both index terms and query keywords. When the results are evaluated by comparing precision values at each recall level, it is found that the word-stem index method is superior to the full-word index method. >",

    "abstract": "An attitude and heading reference system that comprises a low-cost inertial measurement unit and a magnetometer is often inaccurate during highly dynamic motion. To mitigate sensor errors, we used a well-known complementary filter. The basic objective in using this filter was to compensate for the drift in the gyro by using the accelerometer and magnetometer as an assistance component. This paper presents the design of an adaptive mechanism to adjust filter gain using a fuzzy logic controller. We hypothesize that dynamic acceleration and change in dynamic acceleration can be used as inputs for the controller. The controller thus produces two adaptive gains for use as filter gains. The experimental result shows that the estimated angle has a good trend until a specific time, i.e., until the influence of the gyro-drift causes estimated angle divergence.",

The control scheme is constructed from Lyapunov-like function method and an extended Luenberger observer which allows handling the control input saturation. The measured methane flow rate is used to handle the uncertainty on the reaction rate and an update law to handle the uncertainty on the proportional coefficient of the reaction rate. Under the assumptions of the system model are considered: i) the control input is saturated, ii) the values of the kinetic parameters, the biomass concentration and upper or lower bounds are unknown and iii) the output methane flow rate is measured. The main controller characteristics are the following: i) the closed loop states are bounded, ii) the observer error converges to a residual set whose size is user-defined, iii) the tracking error converges to a residual set which is user-defined; provided, the control input does not reach the extreme values. The controller performance is evaluated via numerical simulations showing excellent results.",

A family of approaches exploiting the derivatives with respect to the LR and MF is presented, which does not need to explicitly compute the first two order derivatives in weight space, but rather makes use of the information gathered from the forward and backward procedures. The computational and storage burden for estimating the optimal LR and MF at most triple that of the standard backpropagation algorithm (BPA); however, the backpropagation learning procedure can be accelerated with remarkable savings in running time. Extensive computer simulations provided in this paper indicate that at least a magnitude of savings in running time can be achieved using the present family of approaches. \u00a9 1997 Elsevier Science Ltd.

With the increase of the scale of the rule base, however, the structuring processing itself is a great burden, thus decreasing the efficiency in development. When the knowledge base is to be developed in the sequential and trial-and-error programming style, the knowledge is frequently added or removed, which is a serious problem. From such a viewpoint, a function is provided in OPS5 and in other systems whereby the existing Rete network is modified incrementally when the rule is to be added or removed. There has been no detailed report, however, on such a function. This paper proposes a new structuring method by applying Rete algorithm and discussing its relation to the existing techniques. In the proposed method, the information needed for the modification of the network is derived by feeding the condition pattern composing the condition part of the rule to the current Rete network as a token. The information concerning the consistency between the added rule and the existing rules can also be obtained.",

    "abstract": "The Correlation Clustering problem has been introduced recently [N. Bansal, A. Blum, S. Chawla, Correlation Clustering, in: Proc. 43rd Symp. Foundations of Computer Science, FOCS, 2002, pp. 238-247] as a model for clustering data when a binary relationship between data points is known. More precisely, for each pair of points we have two scores measuring the similarity and dissimilarity respectively, of the two points, and we would like to compute an optimal partition where the value of a partition is obtained by summing up the similarity scores of pairs involving points from the same cluster and the dissimilarity scores of pairs involving points from different clusters. A closely related problem is Consensus Clustering, where we are given a set of partitions and we would like to obtain a partition that best summarizes the input partitions. The latter problem is a restricted case of Correlation Clustering. In this paper we prove that Minimum Consensus Clustering is APX-hard even for three input partitions, answering an open question in the literature, while Maximum Consensus Clustering admits a PTAS. We exhibit a combinatorial and practical 45-approximation algorithm based on a greedy technique for Maximum Consensus Clustering on three partitions. Moreover, we prove that a PTAS exists for Maximum Correlation Clustering when the maximum ratio between two scores is at most a constant.",

    "abstract": "Psychological theories have suggested that creativity involves a twofold process characterized by a generative component facilitating the production of novel ideas and an evaluative component enabling the assessment of their usefulness. The present study employed a novel fMRI paradigm designed to distinguish between these two components at the neural level. Participants designed book cover illustrations while alternating between the generation and evaluation of ideas. The use of an fMRI-compatible drawing tablet allowed for a more natural drawing and creative environment. Creative generation was associated with preferential recruitment of medial temporal lobe regions, while creative evaluation was associated with joint recruitment of executive and default network regions and activation of the rostrolateral prefrontal cortex, insula, and temporopolar cortex. Executive and default regions showed positive functional connectivity throughout task performance. These findings suggest that the medial temporal lobe may be central to the generation of novel ideas and creative evaluation may extend beyond deliberate analytical processes supported by executive brain regions to include more spontaneous affective and visceroceptive evaluative processes supported by default and limbic regions. Thus, creative thinking appears to recruit a unique configuration of neural processes not typically used together during traditional problem solving tasks.",

    "abstract": "We assessed the ability of two algorithms to predict hand kinematics from neural activity as a function of the amount of data used to determine the algorithm parameters. Using chronically implanted intracortical arrays, single- and multineuron discharge was recorded during trained step tracking and slow continuous tracking tasks in macaque monkeys. The effect of increasing the amount of data used to build a neural decoding model on the ability of that model to predict hand kinematics accurately was examined. We evaluated how well a maximum-likelihood model classified discrete reaching directions and how well a linear filter model reconstructed continuous hand positions over time within and across days. For each of these two models we asked two questions: (1) How does classification performance change as the amount of data the model is built upon increases? (2) How does varying the time interval between the data used to build the model and the data used to test the model affect reconstruction? Less than 1 min of data for the discrete task (8 to 13 neurons) and less than 3 min (8 to 18 neurons) for the continuous task were required to build optimal models. Optimal performance was defined by a cost function we derived that reflects both the ability of the model to predict kinematics accurately and the cost of taking more time to build such models. For both the maximum-likelihood classifier and the linear filter model, increasing the duration between the time of building and testing the model within a day did not cause any significant trend of degradation or improvement in performance. Linear filters built on one day and tested on neural data on a subsequent day generated error-measure distributions that were not significantly different from those generated when the linear filters were tested on neural data from the initial day (p<0.05, Kolmogorov-Smirnov test). These data show that only a small amount of data from a limited number of cortical neurons appears to be necessary to construct robust models to predict kinematic parameters for the subsequent hours. Motor-control signals derived from neurons in motor cortex can be reliably acquired for use in neural prosthetic devices. Adequate decoding models can be built rapidly from small numbers of cells and maintained with daily calibration sessions.",

    "abstract": "This paper addresses the problem of how to efficiently manage the power consumption while preserving high visual quality performance in video coding for pervasive video applications. We define an optimization problem that corresponds to the minimization of both the power consumption and video distortion of a video encoder. A joint rate-complexity-distortion(R-C-D) model is developed to capture and control the general R-C-D behavior of video coding. Based on the analysis of the proposed model, optimization strategies are developed to achieve good video quality while maximizing the battery service life. We demonstrate how the observations and optimization strategies can be utilized in a practical parameterized encoder under various preferences of quality and power. We perform simulations on an instruction set simulator to exhibit the effectiveness of the proposed scheme.",

    "abstract": "Datastores today rely on distribution and replication to achieve improved performance and fault-tolerance. But correctness of many applications depends on strong consistency properties--something that can impose substantial overheads, since it requires coordinating the behavior of multiple nodes. This paper describes a new approach to achieving strong consistency in distributed systems while minimizing communication between nodes. The key insight is to allow the state of the system to be inconsistent during execution, as long as this inconsistency is bounded and does not affect transaction correctness. In contrast to previous work, our approach uses program analysis to extract semantic information about permissible levels of inconsistency and is fully automated. We then employ a novel  homeostasis protocol  to allow sites to operate independently, without communicating, as long as any inconsistency is governed by appropriate  treaties  between the nodes. We discuss mechanisms for optimizing treaties based on workload characteristics to minimize communication, as well as a prototype implementation and experiments that demonstrate the benefits of our approach on common transactional benchmarks.",

    "abstract": "Most genetic networks, such as that for the biological clock, are part of much larger modules controlling fundamental processes in the cell, such as metabolism, development, and response to environmental signals. For example, the biological clock is part of a much larger network controlling the circadian rhythms of about 2418 distinct genes in the genome (with 11 000 genes) of the model system,  Neurospora crassa . Predicting and understanding the dynamics of all of these genes and their products in a genetic network describing how the clock functions is a challenge and beyond the current capability of the fastest serial computers. We have implemented a novel variable-topology supernet ensemble method using Markov chain Monte Carlo simulations to fit and discover a regulatory network of unknown topology composed of 2418 genes describing the entire clock circadian network, a network that is found in organisms ranging from bacteria to humans, by harnessing the power of the general-purpose graphics processing unit and exploiting the hierarchical structure of that genetic network. The result is the construction of a genetic network that explains mechanistically how the biological clock functions in the filamentous fungus  N. crassa  and is validated against over 31 000 data points from microarray experiments. Two transcription factors are identified targeting ribosome biogenesis in the clock network.",

This paper analyses this twofold approach, looking for a better understanding about the performance of the interpreter and about the design differences between using event and states. The contributions of this work are (i) the evaluation of some aspects of a proposed and implemented language, (ii) guidelines to choose between events and states to model count-as rules, and (iii) an initial benchmark to evaluate further improvements to the interpreter and the performance of similar proposals.",

Unfortunately, the sharing of complex and stateful hardware resources is a serious threat to time composability: the dependences produced by their history of use cannot always be accurately accounted for by state-of-the-art timing analysis techniques. More recently, the attention paid to the contribution that the Real-Time Operating System (RTOS) can make to achieving -- or breaking -- time composability has grown.

Within these constraints, this article outlines one line of inquiry that seems especially viable: development of a society of robots operating within the physical environments of everyday human life, developing rich robot\u2013robot social exchanges, and yet, refraining from any physical contact with human beings. To pursue this line of inquiry effectively, sustained interactions between specialized research communities in robotics are needed. Notably, suitable robotic hand design and control principles must be adopted to achieve proper robotic manipulation of objects designed for human hands that one finds in human habitats. The Pisa-IIT SoftHand project promises to meet these manipulation needs by a principled combination of sensorimotor synergies and soft robotics actuation, which aims at capturing how the biomechanical structure and neural control strategies of the human hand interact so as to simplify and solve both control and sensing problems.",

    "abstract": "Ad hoc query formulation is an important task in effectively utilizing organizational data resources. To facilitate this task, managers and casual end-users are commonly presented with database views expressly constructed for their use. Differences in the way in which things, states, and events are represented in such views can affect a user's ability to understand the database, potentially leading to different levels of performance (i.e., accuracy, confidence, and prediction of the accuracy of their queries). An experiment was conducted over the Internet involving 342 subjects from 6 universities in North America and Europe to investigate these effects. When presented with an event-based view, subjects expressing low or very low comfort levels in reading entity-relationship diagrams expressed confidence that better predicted query accuracy although there were no significant differences in actual query accuracy or level of confidence expressed.",

    "abstract": "The efficiency of classical RASTA filtering for channel normalisation was investigated for continuous speech recognition based on context-independent and context-dependent hidden Markov models. For a medium and a large vocabulary continuous speech recognition task, recognition performance was established for classical RASTA filtering and compared to using no channel normalisation, cepstrum mean normalisation, and phase-corrected RASTA. Phase-corrected RASTA is a technique that consists of classical RASTA filtering followed by a phase correction operation. In this manner, channel bias is as effectively removed as with classical RASTA. However, for phase-corrected RASTA, amplitude drift towards zero in stationary signal portions is diminished compared to classical RASTA. The results show that application of classical RASTA filtering resulted in decreased recognition performance when compared to using no channel normalisation for all conditions studied, although the decrease appeared to be smaller for context-dependent models than for context-independent models. However, for all conditions, recognition performance was significantly and substantially improved when phase-corrected RASTA was used and reached the same performance level as obtained for cepstrum mean normalisation in some cases. It is concluded that classical RASTA filtering can only be effective for channel robustness, if the impact of the amplitude drift towards zero can be kept as limited as possible.",

    "abstract": "Concentrated animal feeding operations (CAFOs) produce large amounts of animal waste, which potentially pollutes air, soil and water and affects human health if  not appropriately managed. This study uses meteorological and CAFO data and applies an air pollution dispersion model (CALPUFF) to estimate ammonia concentrations at locations downwind of hog CAFOs and to evaluate the disproportionate exposure of children, elderly, whites and minorities to the pollutant. Ammonia is one of the gases emitted by swine CAFOs and could affect human health. Local indicator of spatial autocorrelation (LISA) analysis uses census block demographic data to identify hot spots where both ammonia concentrations and the number of exposed vulnerable population are high. We limit our analysis to one watershed in North Carolina and compare environmental justice issues between 2000 and 2010. Our results show that the average ammonia concentrations in hot spots for 2000 and 2010 were 2.5\u20133-times higher than the average concentration in the entire watershed. The number of people living in the areas where ammonia concentrations exceeded the minimal risk level was 3647 people in 2000 and 3360 people in 2010. We recommend using air pollution dispersion models in future environmental justice studies to assess the impacts of the CAFOs and to address concerns regarding the health and quality of life of vulnerable populations.",

They also recognize their increasing reliance on commercial-off-the-shelf (COTS) information technology (IT) components (software and hardware) necessary to meet the needs of their business missions. As cyberattacks increase in sophistication, stealth, and severity, governments and larger enterprises are taking a more comprehensive approach to risk management and product assurance. Simply improving today's security practices is insufficient. A comprehensive approach involves understanding the practices commercial technology suppliers can employ to protect the integrity of their products and services in the global supply chain--including an understanding of how suppliers manage the risks inherent in globalized product development and manufacturing. This paper outlines the nature of the global technology supply chain, the challenges posed, and the impact on consumers. It describes the added importance of a framework for addressing these challenges based on an approach of IBM, as well as evolving industry open standards efforts to address technology supply chain risks.",

    "abstract": "In this study, we propose a new approach to construct a two-level functional brain network. The nodes of the first-level network are the voxels of the functional Magnetic Resonance Images (fMRI) recorded during an object recognition task. The nodes of the network at the second-level are the anatomic regions of the brain. The arcs of the first level are estimated by a linear regression equation for the meshes formed around each voxel. Neighbors of each voxel are determined by using a functional similarity metric. The node degree distributions of the voxel-level functional brain network are then used to estimate the node attributes and arc weights between the nodes of anatomic regions at the second level. The region-level functional brain network is then used to analyze the relationship among the anatomic regions of the brain during a cognitive process. Our results indicate that, although the neighborhood is defined functionally, voxels tend to make connections within the anatomic regions. Therefore, it can be deduced that nearby voxels work coherently during the cognitive task compared to the voxels apart from each other.",

We propose a strategy for road extraction, vehicle detection and incident detection from remote sensing imagery based on radon transform method. Real time extraction and localization of incident in aerial images is an emerging research area that can be applied to vision-based traffic controlling. The intensity imagery is used to extract the incident from satellite images. Techniques based on neural network, radon transform for angle detection and traffic flow measurements are used for road extraction, vehicle detection and incident detection. The results show that the proposed approach has a good detection performance. The maximum angle of vehicles applied for incident detection is 45\u00b0 and the best performance of the learning system achieved by 87% for detection rate (DR) and a false alarm rate (FAR) under 18% on 45 aerial images of roadways.",

FindiLike leverages large amounts of online reviews about various entities, and ranks entities based on how well their associated reviews match a user's preference query (expressed in keywords). FindiLike then uses abstractive summarization techniques to generate concise opinion summaries to enable users to digest the opinions about an entity. We discuss how the system can be extended to support in situ evaluation of two interesting new tasks, i.e., opinion-based entity ranking and abstractive summarization of opinions. The system is currently supporting hotel search and being extended to support in situ evaluation of these two tasks. We will demonstrate the system in the domain of hotel search and show how in situ evaluation can be supported through natural user interaction with the system.",

Unlike ordinary computer applications, multimedia applications generate large amount of data that has to be processed in real time. This work investigates the problem of efficient multimedia data encryption. A scheme known as the Randomized Huffman Table scheme was recently proposed to achieve encryption along with compression. Though this scheme has several advantages it cannot overcome the chosen plaintext attack. An enhancement of this Huffman scheme is proposed in this work which essentially overcomes the attack and improves the security. The proposed encryption approach consists of two modules. The first module is the Randomized Huffman Table module, the output of which is fed to the second XOR module to enhance the performance. Security analysis shows that the proposed scheme can withstand the chosen plaintext attack. The efficiency and security of the proposed scheme makes it an ideal choice for real time secure multimedia applications.",

The visual cluster validation method attempts to tackle two clustering problems in data mining: to verify partitions of data created by a clustering algorithm; and to identify genuine clusters from data partitions. They are achieved through projecting objects and clusters by Fastmap to the 2D space and visually examining the results by humans. A Monte Carlo evaluation of the visual method was conducted. The validation results of the visual method were compared with the results of two internal statistical cluster validation indices, which shows that the visual method is in consistence with the statistical validation methods.

    "abstract": "In terms of human computer interaction (HCI), the car interior is a space, which can be divided into three areas: the driver's area, the front seat area, and the back seat area. So far HCI researchers have primary focused on the driver, and how in-car electronic devices can be designed to assist the driver in order to increase safety and comfort. We propose that for investigating interactive technology in the car in a holistic way, all three areas have to be taken into account. For that purpose we argue for an increased usage of qualitative in-situ studies, which have been hardly applied in automotive user interface research. So far the HCI community has mainly focused on laboratory studies utilizing driving simulators. Despite the broad range of available field study methods, such as ethnographic and self-reporting studies, the adaption of these methods for the automotive context is challenging due to the specific characteristics of this environment. For instance, cars provide only very limited space, the environment is constantly changing while driving and the driver must not be distracted from driving safely. As a consequence, a lack of experience exists, on how in-situ methods should be applied to cars. In this paper we describe three qualitative in-situ studies, we conducted to research the driver, the front seat passenger, and the rear seat passenger spaces. All three studies used a different method tailored to fit these three areas best. To share our experiences and insights we discuss the strengths and pitfalls of each method.",

In this scheme, number of terminal reconfigurations is defined based on the dwell-time of terminal which is estimated from userpsilas mobility and coverage area of the access point (AP). Each terminal selects one AP from a candidate list that is generated based on userpsilas preferences. Information needed for the selection scheme is obtained from both network-side and terminal-side entities. Four different algorithms are investigated in order to find the best combination of dwell-time and other parameter such as load of APs, to minimize the number of reconfigurations and to achieve load balancing for radio access networks simultaneously.",

    "abstract": "In the present paper we apply a new neurophysiological technique to make single-electrode, dual loose-patch recordings from pairs of neuronal elements in the cerebellar cortex in vivo. The analyzed cell pairs consisted of an inhibitory molecular layer interneuron and a Purkinje cell (PC) or a Golgi cell and a granule cell, respectively. To detect the magnitude of the unitary inhibitory synaptic inputs we used histograms of the spike activity of the target cell, triggered by the spikes of the inhibitory cell. Using this analysis, we found that single interneurons had no detectable effect on PC firing, which could be explained by an expected very low synaptic weight of individual interneuron-PC connections. However, interneurons did have a weak delaying effect on the overall series of interspike intervals of PCs. Due to the very high number of inhibitory synapses on each PC, a concerted activation of the interneurons could still achieve potent PC inhibition as previously shown. In contrast, in the histograms of the Golgi cell-granule cell pairs, we found a weak inhibitory effect on the granule cell but only at the time period defined as the temporal domain of the slow IPSP previously described for this connection. Surprisingly, the average granule cell firing frequency sampled at one second was strongly modulated with a negative correlation to the overall firing level of the Golgi cell when the latter was modified through current injection via the patch pipette. These findings are compatible with that tonic inhibition is the dominant form of Golgi cell-granule cell inhibition in the adult cerebellum in vivo.",

    "abstract": "We propose a modified layered structure for multiple-input multiple-output systems, where the layer detection order is fixed and the data rate for each layer is allocated based on the detection order and channel statistics. Using a Gaussian approximation of the layer capacities, we derive an asymptotic optimum data-rate-allocation approach. For optimum data-rate allocation, the amount of backoff from the mean layer capacity is proportional to the standard deviation of the layer capacity. With statistical data-rate allocation, only limited channel feedback is needed to update channel statistics at the transmitter. Simulation results show significant performance improvement with the proposed algorithm. We also find that the performance gap between the layered structure and the channel capacity diminishes with increasing ergodicity within each codeword. Numerical results show a singal-to-noise ratio improvement of 6.3 and 3.6 dB for TGn channels \"B\" and \"D,\" respectively, for 1% outage probability and 9 b/s/Hz spectral efficiency",

We show that pruned neural networks with small number of hidden nodes and connections are able to recognize all the 10 digits from 0 to 9. Earlier work by other researchers demonstrated how symbolic fuzzy rules can be extracted from trained neural networks to solve this problem. Our rules in contrast are crisp rules, and they are obtained from smaller networks. As a result, simpler and easier to understand rules are obtained. These rules give us an insight of how neural networks differentiate one digit from the rest in LED display recognition problem.",

Regression models are trained for each user in order to estimate the time to edit (TTE) for the current translation segment. We use a combination of features from the current segment and aggregated features from formerly translated segments selected with content-based filtering approaches commonly used in recommendation systems. We present and evaluate decision function heuristics to determine if machine translation output will be useful for the translator in the given segment. We find that our regression models do a reasonable job for some users in predicting TTE given only a small number of training examples; although noise in the actual TTE for seemingly similar segments yields large error margins. We propose to include the estimation of TTE in CAT recommendation systems as a well-correlated metric for translation quality.",

    "abstract": "The information science research community is characterized by a paradigm split, with a system-centered cluster working on information retrieval (IR) algorithms and a user-centered cluster working on user behavior. The two clusters rarely leverage each other's insight and strength. One major suggestion from user-centered studies is to treat the relevance judgment of documents as a subjective, multidimensional, and dynamic concept rather than treating it as objective and based on topicality only. This study explores the possibility to enhance users' topicality-based relevance judgment with subjective novelty judgment in interactive IR. A set of systems is developed which differs in the way the novelty judgment is incorporated. In particular, this study compares systems which assume that users' novelty judgment is directed to a certain subtopic area and those which assume that users' novelty judgment is undirected. This study also compares systems which assume that users judge a document based on topicality first and then novelty in a stepwise, noncompensatory fashion and those which assume that users consider topicality and novelty simultaneously and as compensatory to each other. The user study shows that systems assuming directed novelty in general have higher relevance precision, but systems assuming a stepwise judgment process and systems assuming a compensatory judgment process are not significantly different. \u00a9 2008 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.",

    "abstract": "Visual perception is thought to provide us with the illusion of a stable visual world that is seamless in time and space while it is continuously explored with saccades. The oculomotor system ensures retinal image stabilization during head, object, and surround motion. Prior to manipulation, objects are fixated with topdown driven look-ahead saccades, and similarly, the locomotion path is visually inspected about two steps ahead. In human-human interaction tasks gaze is not only crucial for motor intention recognition but it is also essential in detecting the direction of social attention. A new prototype of a camera motion control unit was developed that provides a sufficiently short latency and a light-weight setup for both a wearable gaze-controlled and a humanoid stereo camera system. The camera system will serve as a binocular eye plant for a humanoid active vision system. The long-term aim is to integrate eye tracking capabilities into the vision system that will equip the humanoid with the ability to infer the target of gaze of a human in human-machine cooperation scenarios. The eye tracking technology has been improved by extending it into the direction of a calibration-free operation. The antropomorphic camera motion control system was integrated into the humanoid JOHNNIE. Thereby, a new experimental tool was created that will help to evaluate the relevance of gaze and look-ahead fixations in the interaction of humans with humanoids in social contexts or during (humanoid) locomotion.",

    "abstract": "Extended regular expressions (ERE) define regular languages using union, concatenation, repetition, intersection, and complementation operators. The fact ERE allow intersection and complementation makes them exponentially more succinct than regular expressions. The membership problem for extended regular expressions is to decide, given an expression r and a word w, whether w belongs to the language defined by r. Since regular expressions are useful for describing patterns in strings, the membership problem has numerous applications. In many such applications, the words w are very long and patterns are conveniently described using ERE, making efficient solutions to the membership problem of great practical interest.In this paper we introduce alternating automata with synchronized universality and negation, and use them in order to obtain a simple and efficient algorithm for solving the membership problem for ERE. Our algorithm runs in time O(m ? n2) and space O(m ? n + k ? n2), where m is the length of r, n is the length of w, and k is the number of intersection and complementation operators in r. This improves the best known algorithms for the problem.",

    "abstract": "In this paper, we propose a novel method named Mixed Kernel CCA (MKCCA) to achieve easy yet accurate implementation of dimensionality reduction. MKCCA consists of two major steps. First, the high dimensional data space is mapped into the reproducing kernel Hilbert space (RKHS) rather than the Hilbert space, with a mixture of kernels, i.e. a linear combination between a local kernel and a global kernel. Meanwhile, a uniform design for experiments with mixtures is also introduced for model selection. Second, in the new RKHS, Kernel CCA is further improved by performing Principal Component Analysis (PCA) followed by CCA for effective dimensionality reduction. We prove that MKCCA can actually be decomposed into two separate components, i.e. PCA and CCA, which can be used to better remove noises and tackle the issue of trivial learning existing in CCA or traditional Kernel CCA. After this, the proposed MKCCA can be implemented in multiple types of learning, such as multi-view learning, supervised learning, semi-supervised learning, and transfer learning, with the reduced data. We show its superiority over existing methods in different types of learning by extensive experimental results.",

    "abstract": "Abstract   Consumer products such as ping-pong paddles, can be designed by blending circles. To be visually pleasing it is desirable that the blend be curvature continuous without extraneous curvature extrema. Transition curves of gradually increasing or decreasing curvature between circles also play an important role in the design of highways and railways. Recently planar cubic and Pythagorean hodograph quintic spiral segments were developed and it was demonstrated how these segments can be composed pairwise to form transition curves that are suitable for G 2  blending. It is now shown that a single cubic curve can be used for blending or as a transition curve with the guarantee of curvature continuity and fairness. Use of a single curve rather than two segments has the benefit that designers and implementers have fewer entities to be concerned with.",

    "abstract": "This paper presents a novel vehicle full-state estimation and prediction system that employs a ldquofull-state vehicle modelrdquo together with lateral acceleration, longitudinal velocity, and suspension displacement sensors to obtain the current and future vehicle state information. The full-state vehicle model is a vehicle model with 6 degrees of freedom (DOFs) and is described by 20-state nonlinear differential equations. The proposed approach differs from those in most of the existing literatures in three aspects. First, the road angles and the nonlinear suspension systems are incorporated into the vehicle modeling. Second, the ldquoswitching observer schemerdquo is introduced to significantly reduce the heavy work load that is required for the mathematical derivations. Finally, the full-state vehicle model is employed to predict the vehicle dynamics at future times. The simulation results show that the proposed system can accurately estimate and predict the state values. The relative accuracy of the state estimation is 2.66% on average and 2.86% on average of the state prediction. Furthermore, the proposed system can predict whether the vehicle rollover will occur when a vehicle performs a quick turn on a slope road.",

By using a perturbation approach, we obtain approximate but explicit closed-form pricing formulae for the option and optimal exercise prices, respectively, under a general multi-scale SV (stochastic volatility) model. A key feature of the expansion methodology employed here is to balance the two SV processes, while dealing with the free boundary conditions properly. It turns out that in the current formulae, the fast volatility factor does not play an explicit role, while the slow factor is quite crucial, a phenomenon that is shown to be quite reasonable through our discussions.",

    "abstract": "A diagnostic method for protein conformational diseases (PCD) from microscopy images is proposed when such conformational conflicts involve muscular intranuclear inclusions (INIs) indicative of oculopharyngeal muscular dystrophy (OPMD), one variety of PCD. The method combines two techniques: (1) the Histogram Region of Interest Fixed by Thresholds (HRIFT) is designed to capture the color information of INIs for basic feature extraction; (2) an automated feature synthesis, based on the HRIFT features, is designed to identify OPMD by means of Genetic Programming and the Expectation Maximization algorithm (GP-EM) for classification improvement. With variations in size, shape, and background structure, a total of 600 microscopic images are analyzed for the binary classes of healthy and sick conditions of OPMD. The integrated technique of the approach reveals a sensitivity of 0.9 and an area of 0.961 under the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) at a specificity of 0.95. Furthermore, significant improvements in classification accuracy and computational time are demonstrated by comparison with other methods.",

Both methods look for similarity by comparing 'program profiles'.

    "abstract": "In developing countries, people's living pressure is increasing with the society's development by inefficient economic growth mode. Recently, the number of people who suffer from sudden cardiac death is progressively increasing, and cardiovascular disease (CVD) has become one great killer which threats the life and health of people. However, at present, we are confronted with one problem: when a patient has chest distress or chest pain, etc., he/she hurries to the hospital to go through electrocardiograph (ECG) examination but the abnormal ECG signal disappears. Therefore, the opportunity to timely capture the ECG status of a patient and make an accurate judgment is lost. Thus, extensive efforts have been made to design various systems for patient monitoring at anytime and anywhere, in order to have real-time records and analysis on vital signal of patents, so as to provide early detection before the occurrence of adverse effect. However, the mobility of the patient is limited in most existing healthcare systems. While sporting is beneficial to improve patient's health, designing a comfortable and durable healthcare system for facilitating patient's movement is a critical issue. This paper presents a novel comfortable and durable portable ECG monitoring system to have real-time monitoring and analysis on a moving user. In the meantime, its special low power and on-demand data collection design alleviates the problem that the current wearable ECG monitoring equipment could not be used for a long time due to the constraint of its battery life.",

This can also result in reducing replacement cost as well as maintaining linearity behavior of pressure sensor\u2019s property. Three-dimensional model was analyzed with material properties; the resonance frequency of the model calculated is 24\u2009kHz and sensitivity is calculated to be 1.2\u2009\u00b5V/V\u00b7kPa. Our result shows that a thin-film technology of sensor design is still a viable solution for vehicular sensor and system measurement development.",

    "abstract": "This paper presents a novel method for semantic annotation and search of a target corpus using several knowledge resources (KRs). This method relies on a formal statistical framework in which KR concepts and corpus documents are homogeneously represented using statistical language models. Under this framework, we can perform all the necessary operations for an efficient and effective semantic annotation of the corpus. Firstly, we propose a coarse tailoring of the KRs w.r.t the target corpus with the main goal of reducing the ambiguity of the annotations and their computational overhead. Then, we propose the generation of concept profiles, which allow measuring the semantic overlap of the KRs as well as performing a finer tailoring of them. Finally, we propose how to semantically represent documents and queries in terms of the KRs concepts and the statistical framework to perform semantic search. Experiments have been carried out with a corpus about web resources which includes several Life Sciences catalogs and Wikipedia pages related to web resources in general (e.g., databases, tools, services, etc.). Results demonstrate that the proposed method is more effective and efficient than state-of-the-art methods relying on either context-free annotation or keyword-based search.",

    "abstract": "An important part of an image-guided surgical system is the display component, and seamless interactivity is critical to its successful application in a clinical environment. In this paper, we present several novel techniques for 4D medical image manipulation and enhancement that employ a graphics processing unit (GPU) to accelerate image processing. We describe three types of voxel color and opacity classification algorithms, and two volume clipping techniques, providing alias-free image quality and improved rendering speed. In addition, we applied a pre-integrated volume shading algorithm to enable less graphics memory consumption and computational cost than traditional shading methods, and a new technique is proposed to improve the quality of the image at the clipping plane in the shaded volume. All of these algorithms have been embedded into our 4D cardiac visualization software framework to provide physicians with real-time visualization and manipulation of volume-rendered medical images",

    "abstract": "Finding defects in software is a challenging and time and budget consuming task. Minimizing these adverse effects using software defect prediction models via guiding testers with defective parts of software system is an attractive research area. Previous research emphasized the value of these tools with a mean probability of detection of 71 percent and mean false alarm rates of 25 percent. This paper examines software defect prediction and aims to improve prediction results using information fusion technique. Results indicate that the prediction results can be improved using Dempster-Shafer Evidence Theory for information fusion.",

    "abstract": "The purpose of this work is to combine the advantages of using visual formalisms for the specification of reactive systems with that of using formal verification and program transformation tools developed for textual formalisms. We have developed a tool suite called ViSta that automatically produces statechart layouts based on information extracted from an informal specification. In this paper, we discuss how ViSta is augmented with a tool that automatically translates statecharts to Z specifications. The informal, statechart and Z specifications are inter-related. This ensures consistency between the different representations, and therefore facilitates the verification and validation effort.",

    "abstract": "Biometric characteristics can be utilized in order to enable reliable and robust-to-impostor-attacks person recognition. Speaker recognition technology is commonly utilized in various systems enabling natural human computer interaction. The majority of the speaker recognition systems rely only on acoustic information, ignoring the visual modality. However, visual information conveys correlated and complimentary information to the audio information and its integration into a recognition system can potentially increase the system's performance, especially in the presence of adverse acoustic conditions. Acoustic and visual biometric signals, such as the person's voice and face, can be obtained using unobtrusive and user-friendly procedures and low-cost sensors. Developing unobtrusive biometric systems makes biometric technology more socially acceptable and accelerates its integration into every day life. In this paper, we describe the main components of audio-visual biometric systems, review existing systems and their performance, and discuss future research and development directions in this area",

    "abstract": "In recent years, automated test-case generation with model-checkers has seen increasing attention in the research community. The use of model-checkers for testing offers full automation, a choice of different methods to derive test-suites, and is efficient under certain preconditions. Model-checkers, however, were not originally intended for this task. Therefore, there are several drawbacks that a tester has to cope with. If model-checkers were designed or adapted to take into account the needs that result from the application to software testing, this could lead to significant improvements with regard to test-suite quality and performance. In this paper, we discuss the drawbacks of current model-checkers when used for testing, and suggest ten ways in which model-checkers could be enhanced to be better suited for the task of test-case generation.",

    "abstract": "We present a formalization of the Recursive Modeling Method, which we have previously, somewhat informally, proposed as a method that autonomous artificial agents can use for intelligent coordination and communication with other agents. Our formalism is closely related to models proposed in the area of game theory, but contains new elements that lead to a difregent solution concept. The advantage of our solution method is that always yields the optimal solution, which is the rational action of the agent in a multi-agent environment, given the agent\u2019s state of knowledge and its preferences, and that it works in realistic cases when agents have only a finite amount of information about the agents they interact with.",

    "abstract": "The number of worldwide e-Government users is growing significantly and their expectations for improved services are continuously increasing. The Internet has become a crucial tool to disseminate information to citizens, however poorly designed websites can drive a wedge between a government and its citizens. Research has shown that the poor usability of government websites is problematic in several countries. Problems experienced with website usability can prevent people from accessing and adopting technology, such as e-Government. A deep understanding of the users' needs is crucial for building a successful digital service. User research can be used to understand how people live their lives, in order to more effectively respond to user needs with informed and inspired design solutions. The focus of this paper is on user research conducted in rural areas to inform the design of a Government website. Focus groups and one-on-one interviews were conducted at Cape Access e-Centres in the Western Cape. This paper illustrates the method used to conduct the user research and explains the results of the study. Results provided insights on the use of smartphones; multiple languages; accessibility; the identification and need for e-services; services required at the e-Centres and services and information required on the website. This was the first user research conducted in rural areas to inform website design in the Western Cape Government.",

    "abstract": "The last years have seen the development of many credit scoring models for assessing the creditworthiness of loan applicants. Traditional credit scoring methodology has involved the use of statistical and mathematical programming techniques such as discriminant analysis, linear and logistic regression, linear and quadratic programming, or decision trees. However, the importance of credit grant decisions for financial institutions has caused growing interest in using a variety of computational intelligence techniques. This paper concentrates on evolutionary computing, which is viewed as one of the most promising paradigms of computational intelligence. Taking into account the synergistic relationship between the communities of Economics and Computer Science, the aim of this paper is to summarize the most recent developments in the application of evolutionary algorithms to credit scoring by means of a thorough review of scientific articles published during the period 2000\u20132012.",

The results showed that the BRD gives a discrimination of heavy biomass burned smoke and dust from others phenomena such as cloud, snow/ice, haze and clear-sky surface. It indicates that the MODIS blue bands contrast provides a potentially simple approach for identification of heavy smoke and dust. This method was applied to detect dust storms over several major dust sources region, including the Gobi Desert, the Red Sea and Afghanistan, and fire smoke over Southeastern Siberia and Alaska. The results showed that comparisons of \u201cblue contrast\u201d are consistent with the aerosol thickness retrieval.",

    "abstract": "In this paper, we have modified a low-voltage, low- power VT (Threshold Voltage) extractor circuit, and by doing this we have obtained results with greater accuracy. At the same time, the output generated from this circuit is found to be robust enough against supply voltage variations. This scheme is based on the most popular extraction algorithm which essentially starts with Id versus VGS characteristics of any MOS transistor operating in saturation. Here the VT extractor block is followed by an offset generator and a feedback block. Now, for the purpose of modification, we have mainly changed the architecture of the offset generator block, keeping rest of the basic blocks unaltered. While doing this we have achieved more accurate results at low supply voltage ranging from 1.2 to 1.8V. In this range, for almost all the cases we found results with excellent accuracy. Whereas, considering the worst case scenario, the maximum deviation from the SPICE-VT value is found to be only 2.9%. Low power consumption, self-compensation for any second-order effect etc. are the key features for this modified architecture. The paper describes the VT extraction scheme, as well as, illustrates the techniques and circuit architecture required for the purpose. The results are supported by SPICE simulations.",

    "abstract": "Increasingly, biological data is being shared over the deep web. Many biological queries can only be answered by successively searching a number of distinct web-sites. This paper introduces a system that exploits parallelization for accelerating search over multiple deep web data sources. An interactive, two-stage multi-threading system is developed to achieve task parallelization, thread parallelization, and pipelined parallelization. We show the effectiveness of our system by considering a number of queries involving SNP datasets. We show that most of the queries can be accelerated significantly by exploiting these three forms of parallelism.",

    "abstract": "A runtime system for implementation of image processing operations is presented. It is designed for working in a flexible and distributed environment related to the software architecture of a newly developed UAV system. The software architecture can be characterized at a coarse scale as a layered system, with a deliberative layer at the top, a reactive layer in the middle, and a processing layer at the bottom. At a finer scale each of the three levels is decomposed into sets of modules which communicate using CORBA, allowing system development and deployment on the UAV to be made in a highly flexible way. Image processing takes place in a dedicated module located in the process layer, and is the main focus of the paper. This module has been designed as a runtime system for data flow graphs, allowing various processing operations to be created online and on demand by the higher levels of the system. The runtime system is implemented in Java, which allows development and deployment to be made on a wide range of hardware/software configurations. Optimizations for particular hardware platforms have been made using Java's native interface.",

The main aim of this paper is to present a consistency model for interval multiplicative preference relation (IMPR). To measure the consistency level for IMPR, a referenced consistent IMPR of a given IMPR is defined, which has the minimum logarithmic distance from the given IMPR. Based on the referenced consistent IMPR, the consistency level of an IMPR can be measured and an IMPR with unacceptable consistency can be adjusted by a proposed algorithm such that the revised IMPR is of acceptable consistency. A consistency model for group decision making (GDM) problems with IMPRs is proposed to obtain the collective IMPR with highest consistency level. Numerical examples are provided to illustrate the validity of the proposed approaches in decision making.",

    "abstract": "In this paper we present and investigate geospatial data mining techniques on different data set to investigate how the promotion of gender equality and empowerment of women is carried out throughout Bangladesh. Promoting gender equality and empowerment of women is one of the goals of the Millennium Development Goals of 2015. The indicators of this paper are women literacy rate, ratio of girls in primary, secondary and tertiary education, and employment history in different sectors of Bangladesh. Our aim is to study these indicators, analyse those statistically and geospatially mining those data with respect to different areas of Bangladesh. We also compare the results of spatial regression model with classical regression model on this data. The results demonstrate that spatial lag model outperforms the classical model in different perspectives. We have found that education indicators have a tendency to produce spatial clusters. It is clear that spatial data mining can provide interesting and useful insights for the government, economists and relevant decision makers. The results can also be used for causal analysis by domain experts.",

    "abstract": "Selectivity estimation for spatial query is very important process in finding the most efficient execution plan. Many works have been performed to estimate accurate selectivity. However, the existing works require a large amount of memory to retain accurate selectivity, and these works can not get good results in little memory environments such as mobile-based small database. In order to solve this problem, we propose a new technique called MW histogram which is able to compress summary data and get reasonable results. The proposed method is based on the spatial partitioning algorithm of MinSkew histogram and wavelet transformation. The experimental results showed that the MW histogram has lower relative error than MinSkew histogram and gets a good selectivity in little memory.",

However a significant issue is that the information needed is not always available. Often this information is derived using manual methods, which is costly in terms of time and money. In this paper we show how techniques taken from other areas may provide more effective and efficient solutions. More specifically machine learning is applied to the problem of automatically deriving loop bounds. The paper shows how taking an approach based on machine learning allows a difficult problem to be addressed with relative ease.",

The first one computes a description of the Morse structure, while the second one computes a simplified version of drainage structures. The topographic significance of the Morse and drainage structures of digital elevation maps (DEMs) suggests that they can been used as the basis of an efficient encoding scheme. As an application we then combine this geometric representation with a consistent interpolation algorithm and lossless data compression schemes to develop an efficient compression algorithm for DEMs. This coding scheme controls the $L^{\\infty}$ error in the decoded elevation map, a property that is necessary for the majority of applications dealing with DEMs. We present the underlying theory and some compression results for standard DEM data.",

With intensive effort made during the last two decades, numerous genes and mutations have been published to be associated with the disease. An organized resource integrating and annotating the ever-increasing genetic data will be imperative to acquire a global view of the cutting-edge in epilepsy research. Herein, we developed EpilepsyGene (http://61.152.91.49/EpilepsyGene). It contains cumulative to date 499 genes and 3931 variants associated with 331 clinical phenotypes collected from 818 publications. Furthermore, in-depth data mining was performed to gain insights into the understanding of the data, including functional annotation, gene prioritization, functional analysis of prioritized genes and overlap analysis focusing on the comorbidity. An intuitive web interface to search and browse the diversified genetic data was also developed to facilitate access to the data of interest. In general, EpilepsyGene is designed to be a central genetic database to provide the research community substantial convenience to uncover the genetic basis of epilepsy.",

The problem is formulated and solved using a multiperiod linear programming model. The model takes into consideration the variability of weather conditions and its effects on the demand for natural gas. Forecasts of future weather conditions are updated several times during the model planning period. Also, the optimal flows of natural gas are determined at the time that the forecasts are updated. The optimal storage quantities at the beginning of each time period and the consequences of contracting for additional storage facilities on the natural gas shortage are derived by using the model. The natural gas planning strategy is to plan natural gas flows based on forecasted future demand. The optimal flows should be recalculated for future time periods at several computational stages of the model, honoring the orders placed during previous time periods.",

The optimisation problem is a mixed-integer quadratic program which is parameterised by the initial state of the system dynamics. The complexity of the problem solved online is reduced by moving part of the computational burden offline. In the offline computations, the structure of the mixed-integer problem is explored to determine a polytopic partition of the set of initial states. Each polytope of the partition is then considered and it is determined which integer combinations can/cannot be optimal, given that the initial state is contained in the current polytope. The result of the offline computations is that each polytope is associated with the set of potentially optimal integer combinations. The online solution of the mixed-integer problem consists of a two-step procedure: first, it is determined which polytope conta...",

This algorithm is similar to Blum's transform in that it fits spheres into a volume, but it is different in that it fits only tangential spheres, and thereby the data reduction is larger than by Blum's transform. The spheres are of variable radii, which enables us to achieve a hierarchy of intrinsic volume properties, i.e., from gross to more detailed. The result of this algorithm is a graph where the nodes are the centers of spheres and the arcs are the connections between two tangent spheres.

Also, unlike other random-walk based methods, our approach does not require any form of user interaction, and can scale to very large images.

The pooling problems were optimized using a piecewise linear scheme that activates appropriate under- and overestimators with a number of binary decision variables that scales linearly with the number of segments in the piecewise relaxation. Inspired by recent work (Vielma & Nemhauser, 2010; Vielma, Ahmed, & Nemhauser, 2010b), we introduce a formulation for the piecewise linear relaxation of bilinear functions with a logarithmic number of binary variables and computationally compare the performance of this new formulation to the best-performing piecewise relaxations with a linear number of binary variables.

    "abstract": "The classical redistribution problem aims at optimally scheduling communications when moving from an initial data distribution to a target distribution where each processor will host a subset of data items. However, modern computing platforms are equipped with a powerful interconnection switch, and the cost of a given communication is (almost) independent of the location of its sender and receiver. This leads to generalizing the redistribution problem as follows: find the optimal one-toone mapping of the subsets of data items onto the processors for which the cost of the redistribution is minimal. This paper studies the complexity of this generalized problem. We provide optimal algorithms and evaluate their gain over classical redistribution through simulations. We also show the NP-hardness of the problem to find the optimal data partition and processor permutation (defined by new subsets) that minimize the cost of redistribution followed by a simple computation kernel.",

    "abstract": "Security is very important for the reliable operation of mobile Ad Hoc networks (MANETs). One of the critical security issues in MANETs is the revocation of misbehaving nodes. In this paper, we propose a trust based threshold cryptography revocation scheme for MANETs. In our proposed scheme, the master private key is split into n pieces according to a random polynomial. Each node in the proposed scheme is configured with a share sk i  of the CA private key SK, the node's public key pk i , and the CA public key PK before joining the network. Meanwhile, the master private key could be recovered by combining any threshold t pieces based on Lagrange interpolation. Consequently, the proposed scheme improves the safety levels in MANETs. The proposed hop-by-hop certificate revocation scheme is based on both threshold cryptography and transitive trust between mobile nodes. Because of the decentralized nature of our proposed scheme, it enables a group of legitimate nodes to perform fast revocation of a nearby misbehaving node. The proposed scheme is highly robust in the mobility environment of MANETs. The advantages of the proposed scheme are justified through extensive simulations.",

    "abstract": "Display Omitted User generated content in social media can provide timely information on ADR detection.We design the labeling heuristic for filtering consumer ADR posts in Web forum.Low-dimension semantic representation can characterize the diversity of ADR posts.The data augmentation via partially supervised learning is effective in filtering ADR posts. ObjectivesAdverse drug reactions (ADRs) are believed to be a leading cause of death in the world. Pharmacovigilance systems are aimed at early detection of ADRs. With the popularity of social media, Web forums and discussion boards become important sources of data for consumers to share their drug use experience, as a result may provide useful information on drugs and their adverse reactions. In this study, we propose an automated ADR related posts filtering mechanism using text classification methods. In real-life settings, ADR related messages are highly distributed in social media, while non-ADR related messages are unspecific and topically diverse. It is expensive to manually label a large amount of ADR related messages (positive examples) and non-ADR related messages (negative examples) to train classification systems. To mitigate this challenge, we examine the use of a partially supervised learning classification method to automate the process. MethodsWe propose a novel pharmacovigilance system leveraging a Latent Dirichlet Allocation modeling module and a partially supervised classification approach. We select drugs with more than 500 threads of discussion, and collect all the original posts and comments of these drugs using an automatic Web spidering program as the text corpus. Various classifiers were trained by varying the number of positive examples and the number of topics. The trained classifiers were applied to 3000 posts published over 60days. Top-ranked posts from each classifier were pooled and the resulting set of 300 posts was reviewed by a domain expert to evaluate the classifiers. ResultsCompare to the alternative approaches using supervised learning methods and three general purpose partially supervised learning methods, our approach performs significantly better in terms of precision, recall, and the F measure (the harmonic mean of precision and recall), based on a computational experiment using online discussion threads from Medhelp. ConclusionsOur design provides satisfactory performance in identifying ADR related posts for post-marketing drug surveillance. The overall design of our system also points out a potentially fruitful direction for building other early warning systems that need to filter big data from social media networks.",

    "abstract": "We present a new tool to analyze three queueing systems which have defied exact analysis so far: (i) the classical  M/G/k  multi-server system, (ii) queueing systems with fluctuating arrival and service rates, and (iii) the  M/G/ 1 round-robin queue. We argue that rather than looking for exact expressions for the mean response time as a function of the job size distribution, a more fruitful approach is to find distributions which minimize or maximize the mean response time given the first n moments of the job size distribution.   We prove that for the  M/G/k  system in light traffic, and given n=2 and 3 moments, these 'extremal' distributions are given by  principal representations  of the moment sequence. Furthermore, if we restrict the distributions to lie in the class of Completely Monotone (CM) distributions, then for all the three queueing systems, for any  n , the extremal distributions under the appropriate \"light traffic\" asymptotics are hyper-exponential distributions with finite number of phases. We conjecture that the property of  extremality  should be invariant to the system load, and thus our light traffic results should hold for general load as well.",

    "abstract": "Ventral occipito-temporal cortex is known to play a major role in visual object recognition. Still unknown is whether object familiarity and semantic domain are critical factors in its functional organization. Most models assume a functional locus where exemplars of familiar categories are represented: the structural description system. On the assumption that familiarity should modulate the effect of visual noise on form recognition, we attempted to individualize the structural description system by scanning healthy subjects while they looked at familiar (living and nonliving things) and novel 3-D objects, either with increasing or decreasing visual noise. Familiarity modulated the visual noise effect (particularly when familiar items were living things), revealing a substrate for the structural description system in right occipito-temporal cortex. These regions also responded preferentially to living as compared to nonliving items. Overall, these results suggest that living items are particularly reliant on the structural description system.",

Over one decade broad- and narrow-band vegetation indices (VIs) were calculated to simulate Landsat ETM+ with in situ hyperspectral reflectance. Principal component analysis (PCA) was utilized to obtain the front two principal components (PCs). Probabilistic neural network (PNN) was employed to classify the lodged and normal rice with VIs and PCs as the input vectors. PCs had 100% of overall accuracy and 1 of Kappa coefficient for the training dataset. While PCs had the greatest average overall accuracy (97.8%) and Kappa coefficient (0.955) for the two testing datasets than VIs consisting of broad- and narrow-bands. The results indicated that hyperspectral remote sensing with PCA and artificial neural networks could potentially be applied to discriminate lodged crops from normal ones at regional and large spatial scales.",

This paper surveys the state of the art in HAR based on wearable sensors. A general architecture is first presented along with a description of the main components of any HAR system. We also propose a two-level taxonomy in accordance to the learning approach (either supervised or semi-supervised) and the response time (either offline or online). Then, the principal issues and challenges are discussed, as well as the main solutions to each one of them. Twenty eight systems are qualitatively evaluated in terms of recognition performance, energy consumption, obtrusiveness, and flexibility, among others. Finally, we present some open problems and ideas that, due to their high relevance, should be addressed in future research.",

    "abstract": "This paper describes the design of a highly accurate proximity sensing system that is capable of operating in a wide distance range. The system is based on passive inductive proximity sensors that can withstand harsh environments, and, therefore, are widely used in avionic applications. Our design methodology consists of determining the ideal trade-off between the sensor excitation method and the computational complexity of processing the response. Once the method is chosen, we create a FPGA design for sensor characterization. Finally, we create the deployment design that uses the characterization data to determine the distance between the passive sensor and the metallic target. Our experimental results show that we are able to measure distances in the range of 0\u20135 mm at 0.1 mm resolution with high accuracy using off-the-shelf passive sensors and FPGA. This is a major improvement over comparable proximity sensing technologies currently available for avionic applications.",

    "abstract": "The efficiency of data transmission over fading channels in orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM) systems depends on the employed interleaving method. In this study, we propose an improved chaotic interleaving scheme which aims to improve the performance of OFDM system under fading channel. In the proposed scheme, the binary data is interleaved with chaotic Baker map prior to the modulation process. In the sequel, significant degree of encryption is being added during data transmission. The performance of the proposed approach is tested on the conventional fast Fourier transform OFDM, discrete wavelet transform OFDM, and discrete cosine transform OFDM with and without chaotic interleaving. Furthermore, an expectation---maximization (EM) algorithm is proposed for improving channel impulse response (CIR) estimation based on a maximum likelihood principle. The proposed scheme makes use of EM algorithm to update the channel estimates until convergence is reached. The simulation results show the efficiency of the proposed algorithms under Rayleigh fading environments where the symbol error rate essentially coincides with that of the perfect channel case after the fifth EM iteration.",

    "abstract": "We present the gravity inversion software GROWTH2.0 and its application to recently obtained gravity data from the volcanic island of Tenerife (Canary Islands, Spain) to inform on its subsurface density structure. GROWTH2.0 is an inversion tool which enables the user to obtain, in a nearly automatic and nonsubjective mode, a 3D model of the subsurface density anomalies based on observed gravity anomaly data. The package is composed of three parts: (a) GRID3D to generate a 3D partition of the subsurface volume into parallelepiped elements, (b) GROWTH to perform the inversion routine and to obtain a 3D anomalous density model, and (c) VIEW for visual representation of the input data, the inversion model, and modeling residuals. The current version of the tool has been developed from an earlier code (Camacho et al., 2002) and now incorporates several novelties: (1) a Graphical User Interface (GUI), (2) an optional automated routine for determination of parameter @l, which controls the balance between model fitness and smoothness, (3) optional determination of values for minimum density contrast, (4) a robust handling of outlier data, and (5) improved automated data reduction for terrain effects based on anticorrelation with topographic data. The new capabilities and applicability of GROWTH2.0 for 3-D gravity inversion are demonstrated by a case example using new gravity data from the volcanic island of Tenerife. In a nearly automatic approach, the software provides a 3-D model informing on the location and shape of the main structural building blocks of the island. Our model results allow us to shed light on the low-density structure of the islands dominant Pico Viejo-Pico Teide (PV-PT) volcanic complex and the identification of an intrusive structure (the east bulge volcano) embedded in Teide's east flank. A low-density body located at around 5.8km depth beneath PT's summit may represent a current magma or hybrid reservoir.",

    "abstract": "This paper proposes a prediction engine designed for non-dedicated clusters, which is able to estimate the turnaround time for parallel applications, even in the presence of serial workload of the workstation owner. The prediction engine can be configured to work with three different estimation kernels: a Historical kernel, a Simulation kernel based on analytical models and an integration of both, named Hybrid kernel. These estimation proposals were integrated into a scheduling system, named CISNE, which can be executed in an on-line or off-line mode. The accuracy of the proposed estimation methods was evaluated in relation to different job scheduling policies in a real and a simulated cluster environment. In both environments, we observed that the Hybrid system gives the best results because it combines the ability of a simulation engine to capture the dynamism of a non-dedicated environment together with the accuracy of the historical methods to estimate the application runtime considering the state of the resources.",

Reliable delivery of content over a hostile land-mobile satellite channel is one of the key technical system requirements that can be addressed at different protocol layers. In this paper, we focus our attention on some of the mechanisms which can provide partial reliability: the packet-level forward error correction (PLFEC) technique in radio access network (RAN), different interleaving depths at physical layer (inter frame) and power allocation in the satellite radio interface. We rely on an end-to-end simulation platform in order to assess the performance gain achieved by these mechanisms separately, and provide clear indications for the achievable benefits at system level when some of these mechanisms act in co-ordination rather than in isolation.",

Black-Scholes pricing method can help make earnings with little risk. Grey theory can decrease the random and implicative noise of tempestuously undulant warrant prices. GA is used to find the best architecture for BPN to avoid local optimum. In experiment, we find that most of selected input variables for BPN include Black-Scholes pricing values and Grey index values. It shows that those two kinds of values are crucial factors. And the earnings rate of warrant outperforms that of the underlying asset. In addition, the proposed model is verified to outperform traditional BPN.

    "abstract": "The basic idea of this paper relies on the concurrent exploitation of the capabilities of neural networks (NNs) and SAR interferometry (InSAR) for the characterization of a seismic source and the estimation of its geometric parameters. When a moderate-to-strong earthquake occurs, we can apply the InSAR technique to compute a differential interferogram. The earthquake is generated by an active seismogenic fault having its own specific geometry. The corresponding differential interferogram contains, in principle, information concerning the geometry of the seismic source that the earthquake comes from. To perform the inversion operation, a novel approach based on NNs is considered. This requires the generation of a statistically significant number of synthetic interferograms necessary for the network training phase.

    "abstract": "Many methods have been researched to prolong the lifetime of sensor networks that use mobile technologies. In the mobile sink research, there are the track based methods and the anchor points based methods as representative operation methods for mobile sinks. However, most existing methods decrease the Quality of Service (QoS) and lead to routing hotspots in the vicinity of the mobile sinks. The main reason is that they use static mobile sink movement paths that ignore the network environment such as the query position and the data priority. In this paper, we propose a novel mobile sink operation method that solves the problems of the existing methods. In our method, the probe priority of the mobile sink is determined from data priority to increase the QoS. The mobility of sink used to reduce the routing hotspot. Experiments show that the proposed method reduces the query response time and improves the network lifetime much more than the existing methods.",

In our framework, we define two kinds of generative model for reranking. One is learned from training data offline and the other from a forest generated by a baseline parser on the fly. The final prediction in the reranking stage is performed using linear interpolation of these models and discriminative model. In order to efficiently train the model from and decode on a hypergraph data structure representing a forest, we apply extended inside/outside and Viterbi algorithms. Experimental results show that our proposed forest reranking algorithm achieves significant improvement when compared with conventional approaches.",

Discrete wavelet transformation (DWT) is used to extract transient information from the measured voltages. Support vector machine (SVM) classifiers are utilized to identify the faulty-section and faulty-half. Bewley diagrams are observed for the traveling wave patterns and the wavelet coefficients of the aerial mode voltage are used to locate the fault. The transient simulation for different fault types and locations are obtained by ATP using frequency-dependent line and cable models. MATLAB is used to process the simulated transients and apply the proposed method. The performance of the method is tested for different fault inception angles (FIA), different fault resistances, non-linear high impedance faults (NLHIF), and non-ideal faults with satisfactory results. The impact of cable aging on the proposed method accuracy is also investigated.",

    "abstract": "A shunt active filter is a power electronic device used in a power system to decrease \u201charmonic current pollution\u201d caused by nonlinear loads. The Echo State Network (ESN) has been widely used as an effective system identifier with much faster training speed than the other Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs). However, only a few attempts have been made to use an ESN as a system controller. As the first attempt to use an ESN in indirect neurocontrol, this paper proposes an indirect adaptive neurocontrol scheme using two ESNs to control a shunt active filter in a multiple-reference frame. As the first step in the proposed neurocontrol scheme, an online system identifier using an ESN is implemented in the Innovative Integration M67 card consisting of the TMS320C6701 processor to identify the load harmonics in a typical electric ship power system. The shunt active filter and the ship power system are simulated using a Real-Time Digital Simulator (RTDS) system. The required computational effort and the system identification accuracy of an ESN with different dynamic reservoir size are discussed, which can provide useful information for similar applications in the future. The testing results in the real-time implementation show that the ESN is capable of providing fast and accurate system identification for the indirect neurocontrol of a shunt active filter.",

We introduce the  At-Most-Once  problem for performing a set of  n  jobs using  m  processors, and we define the notion of efficiency for such protocols, called  effectiveness , that allows the classification of algorithms solving the problem. The effectiveness for an at-most-once implementation is the number of jobs safely completed by the implementation, expressed as a function of the number of jobs  n , the number of processes  m , and the number of process crashes  f . We prove a lower bound of  n -- f  on the effectiveness of any algorithm. We then present two process solutions that offer a trade off between work and space complexity. Finally, we generalize a two-process solution for the multi-process setting using a hierarchical algorithm that achieves effectiveness of  n --log  m \u2020 o ( n ), coming reasonably close, asymptotically, to the corresponding lower bound.",

It is considered that the varying temperature makes the vibration mode axes unstable, which has significant influence on the zero bias stability. This paper will investigate this problem in detail. First, the relationships between the angular positions of vibration mode axes and the zero bias are analyzed. Secondly, the thermal-modal model of the cylinder resonator with several defects such as mass imbalance, frequency split (FS), and geometry errors are developed by ANSYS. Simulation results show that with the increase of temperature, angular positions of the vibration mode axes obviously change, which leads to a dramatic zero bias drift. Finally, several major influence factors on the angular position stability of vibration mode axes, including frequency split, geometry errors, thermal elastic modulus coefficient (TEMC) and thermal expansion coefficient (TEC) are analyzed in detail. Simulation results in this paper will be helpful for deep understanding of the drift principle of zero bias induced by temperature for vibratory cylinder gyroscopes and also be helpful for further temperature compensation or control.",

    "abstract": "Runtime monitoring is necessary for continuous quality assurance of Web Services. Sensors are critical in runtime monitoring to capture the data and detect anomalies. However, sensors in current monitoring systems are usually manually instrumented or hard-coded in the program. It is expensive to implement, and inflexible to change at runtime. The paper extends our previous research on collaborative monitoring and proposes a model-based approach for automatic generating sensors and enforcing policies. Web Services standards WSDL and OWL-S are taken as the models of service interface, workflow, and semantic. Sensors are generated based on the models from two perspectives: (1) dependency analysis of the data, operations, and services with respect to the ontology model of domain concepts and usage context; (2) coverage strategies to decide the specific logic and paths to cover and the data to capture by the monitoring sensors. Policies are defined as a 3-tuple of type, subject and assertion sets and are specified using WS-Policy standards. They are associated to the sensors and enforced at runtime by the policy engine that interoperates with service execution engine to communicate runtime behavior information and verification results. Prototype system is implemented based on the Eclipse platform where sensors are implemented as the listeners to the process execution and instrumented into the middleware including the OWL-S execution engine and SOAP engine. Experiments show that the monitoring results in low overhead of the system performance, reduced effort and enhanced flexibility of sensor instrumentation.",

    "abstract": "In this paper, a novel generalized framework of activity representation and recognition based on a 'string of feature graphs (SFG)' model is introduced. The proposed framework represents a visual activity as a string of feature graphs, where the string elements are initially matched using a graph-based spectral technique, followed by a dynamic programming scheme for matching the complete strings. The framework is motivated by success of time sequence analysis approaches in speech recognition, but modified in order to capture the spatio-temporal properties of individual actions, the interactions between objects, and speed of activity execution. This framework can be adapted to various spatio-temporal motion features, and we show details on using STIP features and track features. Furthermore, we show how this SFG model can be embedded within a switched dynamical system (SDS) that is able to automatically choose the most efficient features for a particular video segment. This allows us to analyze a variety of activities in natural videos in a computationally efficient manner. Experimental results on the basic SFG model as well as its integration with the SDS are shown on some of the most challenging multi-object datasets available to the activity analysis community.",

    "abstract": "With the thriving evolution of information technology, network technology attains to maturity and Wireless Local Area Network (WLAN) becomes universal as well. To discipline the right of network usage, network system identifies users before providing network services or resources. In the historical researches, the conventional authentication mechanisms frequently adopted the names and passwords of users as login authentication. However, these Single Factor Authentication mechanisms are proved to be defective. In virtue of enhancing security, recent researches on authentication are built on Two-Factor Authentication schemes. Nevertheless, the expensive cost of building Two-Factor Authentication approaches has affected the will of users. For the purpose of lifting the rate of usage, in this paper, we apply low-cost passive Radio Frequency Identification (RFID) tag along with the names and passwords of users as login authentication. The analytic comparison indicates the research not only reduces the cost of Two-Factor Authentication schemes, but provides security in the same way as smart cards technology.",

    "abstract": "In this paper, two parallel O(log N) algorithms for the computation of manipulator forward dynamics are presented. They are based on a new O(N) algorithm for the problem which is developed from a new factorization of mass matrix M. Specifically, a factorization of the inverse M/sup -1/ in the form of a Schur complement is derived. The new O(N) algorithm is then developed as a recursive implementation of this factorization. It is shown that the resulting algorithm is strictly parallel, that is, it is less efficient than other algorithms for serial computation of the problem. However, to our knowledge, it is the only algorithm that can be parallelized to derive both a time-optimal O(logN) - and processor-optimal - O(N) - parallel algorithm for the problem. A more efficient parallel O(logN) algorithm based on a multilevel exploitation of parallelism is also briefly described. In addition to their theoretical significance, these parallel algorithms allow a practical implementation due to their simple architectural requirements. >",

    "abstract": "Virtual characters contribute strongly to the entire visuals of 3D animated films. However, designing believable characters remains a challenging task. Artists rely on stylization to increase appeal or expressivity, exaggerating or softening specific features. In this paper we analyze two of the most influential factors that define how a character looks: shape and material. With the help of artists, we design a set of carefully crafted stimuli consisting of different stylization levels for both parameters, and analyze how different combinations affect the perceived realism, appeal, eeriness, and familiarity of the characters. Moreover, we additionally investigate how this affects the perceived intensity of different facial expressions (sadness, anger, happiness, and surprise). Our experiments reveal that shape is the dominant factor when rating realism and expression intensity, while material is the key component for appeal. Furthermore our results show that realism alone is a bad predictor for appeal, eeriness, or attractiveness.",

    "abstract": "In this paper, we propose a method for detection of forgery in ballistic motion videos using motion estimation and modelling. Motion between consecutive frames is estimated using block matching algorithm without interpolation and is represented by a motion vector. State matrices are formed from the motion vector and a Markov process model is applied to it to get the transition probability matrix. By analysing the probability values in this matrix, the transition from one frame to the next is evaluated. For authentic videos, the transition probability matrices for all pair of subsequent frames show uniform characteristics whereas for fake videos, we can see difference in these characteristics. Thus transition probability matrix is used here as a feature vector for classifying a ballistic motion video as an authentic one or fake. The method is evaluated using various original and fake ballistic motion videos and yields good results in both static and moving camera videos.",

    "abstract": "The need for supporting dynamic real-time environments where changes in workloads may occur requires a scheduling framework that explicitly addresses overload conditions, allows the system to achieve graceful degradation and supports a mechanism capable of determining the load to be shed from the system to handle the overload. In applications ranging from video reception to air-craft control, tasks enter periodically and have response time constraints, but missing a deadline is acceptable, provided most deadlines are met. Such tasks are said to be occasionally skippable and have an assigned skip parameter. We look at the problem of uniprocessor scheduling of skippable periodic tasks which consists in maximizing the robustness of the system defined as the global completion ratio. In this paper, we propose a novel scheduling Skip-over algorithm, called RLP/T, a variant of Earliest-Deadline First which adjusts the system workload such that tasks adhere to their timing and skip constraints and guarantees the best robustness.",

A common dilemma faced by software engineers in building complex systems is the lack of clear requirements and domain knowledge needed to come up with a detailed design of the system. Agent technologies are a suitable programming paradigm to cope with the complexity of modern software systems. However, existing agent-based methodologies and tools are developed for experienced programmers and are not suitable for non-agent experts. This paper discusses a domain specific modeling language for multiagent systems that (i) provides a clear syntax and semantics to define agent-based systems in a graphical visualized manner and (ii) can be used to automatically derive code from its design through model transformations.",

    "abstract": "This paper presents effective algorithms for multiway partitioning. Confirming ideas originally due to Hall (1970), we demonstrate that geometric embeddings of the circuit netlist can lead to high-quality k-way partitionings. The netlist embeddings are derived via the computation of d eigenvectors of the Laplacian for a graph representation of the netlist. As Hall did not specify how to partition such geometric embeddings, we explore various geometric partitioning objectives and algorithms, and find that they are limited because they do not integrate topological information from the netlist. Thus, we also present a new partitioning algorithm that exploits both the geometric embedding and netlist information, as well as a restricted partitioning formulation that requires each cluster of the k-way partitioning to be contiguous in a given linear ordering. We begin with a d-dimensional spectral embedding and construct a heuristic 1-dimensional ordering of the modules (combining spacefilling curve with 3-Opt approaches originally proposed for the traveling salesman problem). We then apply dynamic programming to efficiently compute the optimal k-way split of the ordering for a variety of objective functions, including Scaled Cost and Absorption. This approach can transparently integrate user-specified cluster size bounds. Experiments show that this technique yields multiway partitionings with lower Sealed Cost than previous spectral approaches. >",

    "abstract": "Operations on basic data structures such as queues, priority queues, stacks, and counters can dominate the execution time of a parallel program due to both their frequency and their coordination and contention overheads. There are considerable performance payoffs in developing highly optimized, asynchronous, distributed, cache-conscious, parallel implementations of such data structures. Such implementations may employ a variety of tricks to reduce latencies and avoid serial bottlenecks, as long as the semantics of the data structure are preserved. The complexity of the implementation and the difficulty in reasoning about asynchronous systems increases concerns regarding possible bugs in the implementation.#R##N##R##N#In this paper we consider postmortem, black-box procedures for testing whether a parallel data structure behaved correctly. We present the first systematic study of algorithms and hardness results for such testing procedures, focusing on queues, priority queues, stacks, and counters, under various important scenarios. Our results demonstrate the importance of selecting test data such that distinct values are inserted into the data structure (as appropriate). In such cases we present an O(n) time algorithm for testing linearizable queues, an O(n log n) time algorithm for testing linearizable priority queues, and an O( np 2 ) time algorithm for testing sequentially consistent queues, where n is the number of data structure operations and p is the number of processors. In contrast, we show that testing such data structures for executions with arbitrary input values is NP-complete. Our results also help clarify the thresholds between scenarios that admit polynomial time solutions and those that are NP-complete. Our algorithms are the first nontrivial algorithms for these problems.",

    "abstract": "Subsequence identification consists in identifying real positions of a specific video clip in a video stream together with the operations that may be used to transform the former into a subsequence from the latter. In order to cope with this problem, we propose a two-step method. First, a clip filtering strategy based on the identification of dense segments is used, in order to decrease the number of video clip candidates. Then, for each dense segment, a graph matching approach is applied to identify video subsequences similar to the query video. Our main contribution is the use of a simple and efficient distance to solve subsequence identification problem along with the definition of a hit function that identifies precisely which operations were used in query transformation. Experimental results demonstrate good performance for our method (90% recall with 93% precision).",

The algorithm is based on a new pivoting strategy, which is stable in practice. The new algorithm is optimal (up to polylogarithmic factors) in the amount of communication it performs.   Our experiments show that CALU leads to a reduction in the parallel time, in particular when the latency time is an important factor of the overall time. The factorization of a block-column, a subroutime of CALU, outperforms the corresponding routine PDGETF2 from ScaLAPACK up to a factor of  4.37  on an IBM POWER 5 system and up to a factor of  5.58  on a Cray XT4 system. On square matrices of order 10 4 , CALU outperforms the corresponding routine PDGETRF from ScaLAPACK by a factor of  1.24  on IBM POWER 5 and by a factor of  1.31  on Cray XT4.",

    "abstract": "Biomarker discovery aims to find small subsets of relevant variables in \u2018omics data that correlate with the clinical syndromes of interest. Despite the fact that clinical phenotypes are usually characterized by a complex set of clinical parameters, current computational approaches assume univariate targets, e.g. diagnostic classes, against which associations are sought for. We propose an approach based on asymmetrical sparse canonical correlation analysis (SCCA) that finds multivariate correlations between the \u2018omics measurements and the complex clinical phenotypes. We correlated plasma proteomics data to multivariate overlapping complex clinical phenotypes from tuberculosis and malaria datasets. We discovered relevant \u2018omic biomarkers that have a high correlation to profiles of clinical measurements and are remarkably sparse, containing 1.5\u20133% of all \u2018omic variables. We show that using clinical view projections we obtain remarkable improvements in diagnostic class prediction, up to 11% in tuberculosis and up to 5% in malaria. Our approach finds proteomic-biomarkers that correlate with complex combinations of clinical-biomarkers. Using the clinical-biomarkers improves the accuracy of diagnostic class prediction while not requiring the measurement plasma proteomic profiles of each subject. Our approach makes it feasible to use omics' data to build accurate diagnostic algorithms that can be deployed to community health centres lacking the expensive \u2018omics measurement capabilities.",

For 5 of the 9 virtual screens, compounds that docked best to the receptors clearly recapitulated known biological functions of the genes or identified novel biology subsequently validated in a separate experimental study. In two cases, the hit list indicated some relevant but isolated biological functions which would probably have been ignored a priori, and selected compounds were completely unrelated to gene function for the last two virtual screens. This study demonstrates that virtual screening of pharmacologically annotated compound libraries can be used to derive target biology.",

This paper presents a novel scaling algorithm for the implementation of 2-D image scalar. The proposed interpolation method is based on the interpolation error theorem often mentioned in numerical analysis. A bilateral error-amender is used to make the interpolation more precise, and an edge-weighted scheme enhances the edge features of the scaled images. Extensive experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method can obtain better performance than previous methods in both quantitative evaluation and visual quality. This paper also presents an efficient very large-scale integrated architecture for the proposed method. The cooperation and hardware sharing techniques greatly reduce hardware cost requirements. Using a nine-stage pipeline, the proposed scaling circuit contains 13 k gate counts and yields a processing rate of approximately 278 MHz using TSMC 0.13- \u03bcm technology. The hardware cost of the proposed circuit is low, making it a good candidate for high-quality image scaling applications.",

To test whether PDD subjects show specific amyloid binding in vivo and whether this could reflect fibrillar \u03b1-synuclein accumulation, we investigated 10 PDD subjects with [ 11 C]PIB-PET.

Furthermore, postmortem sections of 4 patients with Parkinson's disease (PD), therefrom 2 with dementia (PDD), and of 6 controls were stained with PIB to evaluate the histological distribution of the fluorescent ligand in the brainstem. In PET, only 2 PDD patients displayed increased PIB binding to cortical amyloid comparable to AD patients. The other 8 patients showed control-like cortical findings but elevated PIB binding in the pons and mesencephalon. Fluorescence microscopy showed PIB binding to Lewy bodies and neuromelanin in the substantia nigra of PD and PDD brainstem sections, but not in controls. These data suggest that PIB-PET can be used to further differentiate PDD with respect to cortical amyloid. Furthermore, we provide evidence that \u2013 in addition to nonspecific binding \u2013 PIB uptake in the brainstem may also reflect PDD related amyloid.",

    "abstract": "It is well-known that a matrix inversion is required within the affine projection algorithm (APA). Depending on the character of the input signal, this matrix can be very ill-conditioned. Consequently, it needs to be regularized before inversion, i.e., a positive constant is added to the elements of its main diagonal. Also known as the regularization parameter, this constant plays a major role in practice; if it is not chosen properly, the APA may never converge, especially under low signal-to-noise ratio conditions. The contribution of this paper is twofold. First, we provide a formula for choosing an \u201coptimal\u201d regularization parameter, aiming at attenuating the effects of the noise in the adaptive filter estimate. Second, two practical ways for evaluating this parameter are proposed. Simulations performed in the context of acoustic echo cancellation (in different noisy environments) prove the validity of the proposed solutions.",

As a consequence, weak emergence is about tokens, not types, of states. I conclude by examining the question of whether the concept of weak emergence is too weak and note that there is at present no unifying account of diachronic and synchronic concepts of emergence.",

    "abstract": "This paper presents a novel method of rule extraction by encoding the knowledge of the data into an SVM classification tree (SVMT), and decoding the trained SVMT into a set of linguistic association rules. The method of rule extraction over the SVMT (r-SVMT), in the spirit of decision-tree rule extraction, achieves rule extraction not only from SVM, but also over the obtained decision-tree structure. The benefits of r-SVMT are that the decision-tree rule provides better comprehensibility, and the support-vector rule retains the good classification accuracy of SVM. Furthermore, the r-SVMT is capable of performing a very robust classification on such datasets that have seriously, even overwhelmingly, class-imbalanced data distribution, which profits from the super generalization ability of SVMT owing to the aggregation of a group of SVMs. Experiments with a gaussian synthetic data, seven benchmark cancers diagnosis have highlighted the utility of SVMT and r-SVMT on encoding and decoding rule knowledge, as well as the superior properties of r-SVMT as compared to a completely support-vector based rule extraction.",

    "abstract": "We describe Charm++, an object oriented portable parallel programming language based on C++. Its design philosophy, implementation, sample applications and their performance on various parallel machines are described. Charm++ is an explicitly parallel language consisting of C++ with a few extensions. It provides a clear separation between sequential and parallel objects. The execution model of Charm++ is message driven, thus helping one write programs that are latency-tolerant. The language supports multiple inheritance, dynamic binding, overloading, strong typing, and reuse for parallel objects, all of which are more difficult problems in a parallel context. Charm++ provides specific modes for sharing information between parallel objects. It is based on the Charm parallel programming system, and its runtime system implementation reuses most of the runtime system for Charm.",

    "abstract": "In this paper we study minimum cut and maximum flow problems on planar graphs, both in static and in dynamic settings. First, we present an algorithm that given an undirected planar graph computes the minimum cut between any two given vertices in O(n log log n) time. Second, we show how to achieve the same O(n log log n) bound for the problem of computing maximum flows in undirected planar graphs. To the best of our knowledge, these are the first algorithms for those two problems that break the O(n log n) barrier, which has been standing for more than 25 years. Third, we present a fully dynamic algorithm that is able to maintain information about minimum cuts and maximum flows in a plane graph (i.e., a planar graph with a fixed embedding): our algorithm is able to insert edges, delete edges and answer min-cut and max-flow queries between any pair of vertices in O(n^(2/3) log^3 n) time per operation. This result is based on a new dynamic shortest path algorithm for planar graphs which may be of independent interest. We remark that this is the first known non-trivial algorithm for min-cut and max-flow problems in a dynamic setting.",

In this paper, a new approach for facial expression recognition (FER) based on fusion of sparse representation is proposed. The new algorithm first solves two sparse representations both on raw gray facial expression images and local binary patterns (LBP) of these images. Then two expression recognition results are obtained on both sparse representations. Finally, the final expression recognition is performed by fusion on the two results. The experiment results on Japanese Female Facial Expression database JAFFE show that the proposed fusion algorithm is much better than the traditional methods such as PCA and LDA algorithms.",

    "abstract": "On-line social networking sites often involve multiple relations simultaneously. While people can build an explicit social network by adding each other as friends, they can also form several implicit social networks through their daily interactions like commenting on people's posts, or tagging people's photos. So given a real social networking system which changes over time, what can we say about people's social behaviors ? Do their daily interactions follow any pattern ? The majority of earlier work mainly mimics the patterns and properties of a single type of network. Here, we model the formation and co-evolution of multi-modal networks emerging from different social relations such as \"who-adds-whom-as-friend\" and \"who-comments-on-whose-post\" simultaneously. The contributions are the following : (a) we propose a new approach called EigenNetwork Analysis for analyzing time-evolving networks, and use it to discover temporal patterns with people's social interactions; (b) we report inherent correlation between friendship and co-occurrence in on-line settings; (c) we design the first multimodal graph generator xSocial 1 that is capable of producing multiple weighted time-evolving networks, which match most of the observed patterns so far. Our study was performed on two real datasets (Nokia FriendView and Flickr) with 100,000 and 50,000,000 records respectively, each of which corresponds to a different social service, and spans up to two years of activity.",

    "abstract": "This article describes the Sugar Production Factor and its structural equivalent, the Personal Interaction task. These are two simple, individual dynamic decision-making tasks in which subjects make interdependent decisions to reach a goal, and receive feedback on the outcome of their efforts along the way. An important result from human learning experiments using these two tasks and their variants is that subjects reliably improve their ability to reach the goal over a moderate number of training trials (40\u201390) but do not show consistent improvement in other measures of task knowledge. These other measures focus on subjects' ability to accurately predict the task environment's response to their actions and subjects' ability to produce useful heuristics. This pattern of results runs counter to the idea that decision makers' performance in dynamic decision tasks depends critically on the predictive accuracy their internal models of the task environment. Variants of both tasks have been used to manipulate this pattern of results and explore more deeply the nature of the internal models that subjects form of the task environment. These variants are discussed in the context of other relevant findings in the dynamic decision making literature.",

    "abstract": "We consider the problem of learning in repeated games against arbitrary associates. Specifically, we study the ability of expert algorithms to quickly learn effective strategies in repeated games, towards the ultimate goal of learning near-optimal behavior against any arbitrary associate within only a handful of interactions. Our contribution is three-fold. First, we advocate a new metric, called disappointment, for evaluating expert algorithms in repeated games. Unlike minimizing traditional notions of regret, minimizing disappointment in repeated games is equivalent to maximizing payoffs. Unfortunately, eliminating disappointment is impossible to guarantee in general. However, it is possible for an expert algorithm to quickly achieve low disappointment against many known classes of algorithms in many games. Second, we show that popular existing expert algorithms often fail to achieve low disappointment against a variety of associates, particularly in early rounds of the game. Finally, we describe a new meta-algorithm that can be applied to existing expert algorithms to substantially reduce disappointment in many two-player repeated games when associates follow various static, reinforcement learning, and expert algorithms.",

    "abstract": "Following a toxic contaminant release, either accidental or intentional, predicting the transport and dispersion of the contaminant becomes a critical problem for Homeland Defense and DoD agencies. To produce accurate predictions requires characterizing both the source of hazardous material and the local meteorological conditions. Decision makers use information on contaminant source location and transport prediction to decide on the best methods to mitigate and prevent effects. The problem has both observational and computational aspects. Field monitors are likely to be used to detect the release and measure concentrations of the toxic material. Algorithms are then required to invert the problem in order to infer the characteristics of the source and the local meteorology. Here, a genetic algorithm is coupled with transport and dispersion models to assimilate sensor data in order to characterize emission sources and the wind vector. The parameters computed include two dimensional source location, amount of the release, and wind direction. This methodology is demonstrated for a basic Gaussian plume dispersion model and verified in the context of an identical twin numerical experiment, in which synthetic dispersion data is created with the same dispersion model. Error bounds are set using Monte Carlo techniques and robustness assessed by adding white noise. Algorithm speed is tuned by optimizing the parameters of the genetic algorithm. Specific GA configurations and cost function formulations are discussed.",

    "abstract": "The performance evaluation of delay-tolerant CFDP is seen in the literatures. In this work, we focus on experimental performance investigation of the delay-tolerant CFDP in the deferred NAK mode over a simulated low earth orbit (LEO)-satellite communication link. A rate-based transmission protocol is taken as a reference. This work is to see how the delay-tolerant CFDP protocol performs over a LEO- satellite link delay, especially when compounded with a high bit- error-rate (BER). The investigation results show that the rate- based protocol shows superior throughput performance over both symmetric and asymmetric channels, especially at higher BERs. Quantitatively, the throughput advantage of the rate- based protocol over CFDP-TCP in symmetric channel at BER=10\"5 is approximately 2200 bytes/sec, and in asymmetric channel is approximately 8500 bytes/sec.",

    "abstract": "A mixed-design experiment was conducted to explore differences between searching and surfing on cognitive and emotional responses to online news. Ninety-two participants read three unpleasant news stories from a website. Half of the participants acquired their stories by searching, meaning they had a previous information need in mind. The other half of the participants acquired their stories by surfing, with no previous information need in mind. Heart rate, skin conductance, and corrugator activation were collected as measures of resource allocation, motivational activation, and unpleasantness, respectively, while participants read each story. Self-report valence and recognition accuracy were also measured. Stories acquired by searching elicited greater heart rate acceleration, skin conductance level, and corrugator activation during reading. These stories were rated as more unpleasant, and their details were recognized more accurately than similar stories that were acquired by surfing. Implications of these results for understanding how people process online media are discussed.",

Let X be an infinite-dimensional Frechet space and let V = { V n } be a nested sequence of subspaces of X such that V n \u017a \u017a V n + 1 for any n \u017a N . Let e n be a decreasing sequence of positive numbers tending to 0. Under one additional but necessary condition on sup { dist ( x , V n ) } , we prove that there exist x \u017a X and n o \u017a N such that e n 3 \u017a dist ( x , V n ) \u017a 3 e n for any n \u017a n o . By using the above theorem, as a corollary we obtain classical Shapiro's (1964) and Tyuriemskih's (1967) theorems for Banach spaces. Also we prove versions of both Shapiro's (1964) and Tyuriemskih's (1967) theorems for Frechet spaces. Considering rapidly decreasing sequences, other versions of the BLT theorem in Frechet spaces will be discussed. We also give a theorem improving Konyagin's (2014) result for Banach spaces. Finally, we present some applications of the above mentioned result concerning particular classes of Frechet spaces, such as Orlicz spaces generated by s -convex functions and locally bounded Frechet spaces.",

    "abstract": "When evaluating a generation system, if a corpus of target outputs is available, a common and simple strategy is to compare the system output against the corpus contents. However, cross-validation metrics that test whether the system makes exactly the same choices as the corpus on each item have recently been shown not to correlate well with human judgements of quality. An alternative evaluation strategy is to compute intrinsic, task-specific properties of the generated output; this requires more domain-specific metrics, but can often produce a better assessment of the output. In this paper, a range of metrics using both of these techniques are used to evaluate three methods for selecting the facial displays of an embodied conversational agent, and the predictions of the metrics are compared with human judgements of the same generated output. The corpus-reproduction metrics show no relationship with the human judgements, while the intrinsic metrics that capture the number and variety of facial displays show a significant correlation with the preferences of the human users.",

    "abstract": "In this paper, we present a complete framework for recovering an object shape, estimating its reflectance properties and light sources from a set of images. The whole process is performed automatically. We use the shape from silhouette approach proposed by R. Szeliski (1993) combined with image pixels for reconstructing a triangular mesh according to the marching cubes algorithm. A classification process identifies regions of the object having the same appearance. For each region, a single point or directional light source is detected. Therefore, we use specular lobes, lambertian regions of the surface or specular highlights seen on images. An identification method jointly (i) decides what light sources are actually significant and (ii) estimates diffuse and specular coefficients for a surface represented by the modified Phong model (Lewis, 1994). In order to validate our algorithm efficiency, we present a case study with various objects, light sources and surface properties. As shown in the results, our system proves accurate even for real objects images obtained with an inexpensive acquisition system.",

For k = 1,...,n let B(A, \u03c3k) be the bipartite graph with vertices \u03c11,..., \u03c12n, c1, ..., c2n and 4n edges [\u03c1i, cj] corresponding to ordered pairs (i,j) such that aij = \u03c3k. We say that A is Hamiltonian if B(A, \u03c3k) is a cycle of length 4n for k = 1 ,..., n. Two double latin squares (aij), (a'ij) of order 2n on symbols \u03c31,...,\u03c3n are said to be orthogonal if for each ordered pair (\u03c3h, \u03c3k) of symbols there are four ordered pairs (i,j) such that aij = \u03c3h, a'ij = \u03c3k.We explore ways of constructing Hamiltonian double latin squares (HLS), symmetric HLS, sets of mutually orthogonal HLS and pairs of orthogonal symmetric HLS. We identify those arrays which can be obtained from HLS by amalgamating rows and amalgamating columns in a certain sense, and we prove a similar result concerning symmetric arrays obtainable in this way from symmetric HLS. These results can be proved either by using matroids or by a more elementary method, and we illustrate both approaches. From these results we deduce a characterisation of those matrices which are submatrices of HLS on n symbols, a similar result concerning symmetric submatrices of symmetric HLS and some related results. Much of our discussion uses graph-theoretic language, since HLS on n symbols are equivalent to decompositions of K2n,2n into Hamiltonian cycles and symmetric HLS on n symbols are equivalent to decompositions of K2n into Hamiltonian paths (and these are equivalent to decompositions of K2n+1 into Hamiltonian cycles).",

    "abstract": "This study examined the role of decision-making biases (i.e., inertia, overconfidence, illusion of control) in consumer retrust in electronic word of mouth (eWOM) recommendations and the risk-reducing strategies of consumers. An online survey was conducted. Of the 592 questionnaires collected, 567 responses were suitable for analysis. The response rate was 95.78%. This study revealed that inertia and overconfidence biases affect retrust in word-of-mouth recommendations. In addition, consumers with a stronger illusion of control bias place less trust in eWOM after having a negative experience. Furthermore, the results indicated that the associations between risk-reducing strategies and retrust in eWOM differ. On the theoretical level, this paper provides an understanding of the effects of inertia, overconfidence, and the illusion of control on eWOM retrust. In addition, this paper fills a gap in the literature, thus advancing knowledge on how and why consumers retrust eWOM. The results of the current study provide useful knowledge enabling firms to understand decision-making biases and, thus, manage relationships with potential customers and improve the quality of their products and services. For example, relying on an eWOM Web site image was determined to be the primary risk-reducing strategy in retrusting eWOM. Firms should continually track the flow of eWOM on eWOM-posting Web sites.",

    "abstract": "This paper studies normalized least mean square-based adaptive sparse filtering algorithms for estimating multiple-input multiple-output MIMO channels. Although the MIMO channel is often modeled as sparse, traditional normalized least mean square-based filtering algorithm never takes the advantage of the inherent sparse structure information and thus causes some performance loss. Unlike the traditional method, the proposed two adaptive sparse channel estimation methods exploit the sparse structure information of MIMO channels. To validate the effectiveness of proposed MIMO channel estimates, theoretical analysis and simulation results are provided. We derive steady-state mean-square deviations of the proposed MIMO channel estimates and theoretically show that it is better than the traditional one. Moreover, their performance advantages are confirmed by computer simulations. Copyright \u00a9 2014 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.",

    "abstract": "It is difficult to directly apply conventional significance tests to compare the performance of network classification models because network data instances are not independent and identically distributed. Recent work [6] has shown that paired t-tests applied to overlapping network samples will result in unacceptably high levels (e.g., up to 50%) of Type I error (i.e., the tests lead to incorrect conclusions that models are different, when they are not). Thus, we need new strategies to accurately evaluate network classifiers. In this paper, we analyze the sources of bias (e.g. dependencies among network data instances) theoretically and propose analytical corrections to standard significance tests to reduce the Type I error rate to more acceptable levels, while maintaining reasonable levels of statistical power to detect true performance differences. We validate the effectiveness of the proposed corrections empirically on both synthetic and real networks.",

In this paper, a generalized nonlinear hybrid dynamical system is proposed to describe this process under continuous culture based on three different transport modes of glycerol across cell membrane. In the system, the inhibitory effect of 3-hydroxypropionaldehyde to the activities of two key enzymes (glycerol dehydratase and 1,3-propanediol oxydoreductase) and to the specific cell growth rate are all taken into consideration. To infer the most reasonable transport mode of glycerol across cell membrane on the hypothesis that 1,3-propanediol passes cell membrane by both passive diffusion and active transport, a quantitative definition of biological robustness for intracellular substances is presented. Taking the presented biological robustness and relative error between experimental data and computational values as performance index, a system identification model is established. Numerical results show that it is most possible for glycerol to pass cell membrane by passive diffusion.",

PVMs have been used to provide tamper detection, dynamic code obfuscation, and resistance to static disassembly. Over-all, the presence of PVMs makes it more difficult for the adversary to achieve their goals. Recently, a new attack methodology, called Replacement Attacks, was described that successfully targeted PVM-protected applications. This methodology circumvents execution of the protective PVM instance through the use of another virtual machine to execute the program. The replacement occurs dynamically and allows execution of the application without any PVM-based protections. In this work, we formalize the notion of a replacement attack using a novel model. We then present a defense against such attacks. To the best of our knowledge, this technique is the first defense against replacement attacks. The technique relies on software interpretation of instructions, which forms the basis of PVMs. By carefully modifying the semantics of some individual instructions, it is possible to make the application unusable without the presence of the protective PVM instance. The technique is called PointISA, named after a point function|a function which returns true for only one given input. We provide a formal description of PointISAs and an evaluation of the strength of the approach.",

    "abstract": "This study presents time-domain and frequency-domain, multiple-input, multiple-output (MIMO) linear system identification techniques that can be used to estimate the dynamic endpoint stiffness of a multijoint limb. The stiffness of a joint or limb arises from a number of physiological mechanisms and is thought to play a fundamental role in the control of posture and movement. Estimates of endpoint stiffness can therefore be used to characterize its modulation during physiological tasks and may provide insight into how the nervous system normally controls motor behavior. Previous MIMO stiffness estimates have focused upon the static stiffness components only or assumed simple parametric models with elastic, viscous, and inertial components. The method presented here captures the full stiffness dynamics during a relatively short experimental trial while assuming only that the system is linear for small perturbations. Simulation studies were performed to investigate the performance of this approach under typical experimental conditions. It was found that a linear MIMO description of endpoint stiffness dynamics was sufficient to describe the displacement responses to small stochastic force perturbations. Distortion of these linear estimates by nonlinear centripetal and Coriolis forces was virtually undetectable for these perturbations. The system identification techniques were also found to be robust in the presence of significant output measurement noise and input coupling. These results indicate that the approach described here will allow the estimation of endpoint stiffness dynamics in an experimentally efficient manner with minimal assumptions about the specific form of these properties.",

The proposed cell consists of one transistor and one MTJ (1T1MTJ) with biaxial magnetic layer to store two bits per cell. Using the four stable states of the biaxial layer, the proposed cell allows 2 bits to be stored per cell without voltage headroom limitations. Current pulses with different amplitudes are applied during write operation to switch the magnetization vector to the corresponding region. This avoids multi-step write operations required for previously proposed multi-level cells using uniaxial MTJs. On average, the simulated write speed of the proposed cell is 33% faster than that of previous work, and the proposed cell consumes 8% less power. Also, current sensing vs. voltage sensing is compared for the biaxial MTJ, Current sensing provides uniform distribution of the sense margin.",

Furthermore, Circus has an associated refinement calculus, which can be used to develop software in a precise and stepwise fashion. Each step is justified by the application of a refinement law (possibly with the discharge of proof obligations). Sometimes, the same laws can be applied in the same manner in different developments or even in different parts of a single development. A strategy to optimize this calculus is to formalise this application as a refinement tactic, which can then be used as a single transformation rule. CRefine was developed to automate the Circus refinement calculus. However, before the work presented here, it did not provide support for refinement tactics. In this paper, we present an extension to CRefine: a new module that automates the process of defining and applying refinement tactics formalised in the tactic language ArcAngel C.

    "abstract": "The present study investigated the effects of online brand community identity on the characteristics of community activity and behavioral responses. Based on empirical research using questionnaires with 117 consumers who were participating in an online brand community, the study found the following results: First, online brand community identity affected normative community pressure and community bond, and the normative community pressure had a negative effect on the user's intention to maintain participation in the community. Second, online brand community bond did not have a statically significant effect on normative community pressure. Lastly, online brand community bond affected community commitment, which, in turn, affected the user's intention to maintain participation, collaborative brand production, and brand word-of-mouth activities. The results of the study shed light on the importance of exerting efforts to manage consumer relationships through online brand community, particularly for the industry where online brand community leads to brand purchasing behavioral responses of their consumer.",

    "abstract": "We argue that a logic programming language with a higher-order intuitionistic logic as its foundation can be used both to naturally specify and implement tactic-style theorem provers. The language extends traditional logic programming languages by replacing first-order terms with simply-typed \u03bb-terms, replacing first-order unification with higher-order unification, and allowing implication and universal quantification in queries and the bodies of clauses. Inference rules for a variety of inference systems can be naturally specified in this language. The higher-order features of the language contribute to a concise specification of provisos concerning variable occurrences in formulas and the discharge of assumptions present in many inference systems. Tactics and tacticals, which provide a framework for high-level control over search for proofs, can be directly and naturally implemented in the extended language. This framework serves as a starting point for implementing theorem provers and proof systems that can integrate many diversified operations on formulas and proofs for a variety of logics. We present an extensive set of examples that have been implemented in the higher-order logic programming language \u03bbProlog.",

    "abstract": "Cognitive radio, which enables smart use of wireless resources, is a key ingredient to achieve high spectral efficiency. LTE, the latest evolution of cellular standards, is widely adopted and also targets high spectral efficiency. Hence, to enable wide adoption of cognitive radio, using LTE as the physical layer is a natural choice. Targeting a real-time implementation of LTEbased cognitive radio, we focus on spatial interweave cognitive radio, in which a secondary user uses an antenna array to perform null-beamforming in the primary user's direction, hence reusing the spectrum spatially. To allow this, without any help from the primary system, we use the time-division duplex mode and take advantage of the channel reciprocity. However, this reciprocity is jeopardized by the mismatch between the RF front-ends. Hence, we design a calibration protocol to restore it. A key contribution is that this cognitive system calibration does not require cooperation from the primary user. The whole system is implemented and evaluated on EURECOM's experimental OpenAirInterface platform. Performance results are presented, showing the feasibility of spatial interweave cognitive radio on a real-time platform.",

This paper proposes a novel motion recognition method based on haptic data (i.e., position and force information). First, haptic data are obtained using a bilateral control system. Second, the haptic data are divided into action components, using modal transformation. Finally, both the position and the force information in each action component are compared with recorded data. A dynamic programming pattern-matching algorithm is used to recognize the desired motion, and the validity of the proposed method is verified experimentally. In the experiments, the proposed method is applied to a grasping motion. The proposed method can trigger scaled bilateral control and assist the operator in real time.",

    "abstract": "Random walks in wireless sensor networks can serve as fully local, very simple strategies for sink motion that significantly reduce energy dissipation a lot but increase the latency of data collection. To achieve satisfactory energy-latency trade-offs the sink walks can be made adaptive, depending on network parameters such as density and/or history of past visits in each network region; but this increases the memory requirements. Towards better balances of memory/performance, we propose three new random walks: the Random Walk with Inertia, the Explore-and-Go Random Walk and the Curly Random Walk; we also introduce a new metric (Proximity Variation) that captures the different way each walk gets close to the network nodes over time. We implement the new walks and experimentally compare them to known ones. The simulation findings demonstrate that the new walks' performance (cover time) gets close to the one of the (much stronger) biased walk with memory, while in some other respects (partial cover time, proximity variation) they even outperform it. We note that the proposed walks have been fine-tuned in the light of experimental findings.",

The effect of uncertainties in concentration measurements on the estimation of model parameters is analyzed for two cases of non-isocratic adsorption chromatography. A model, calibrated to experiments, is used to generate data by adding a Monte Carlo sampled error in the inlet concentrations. New model parameters are estimated by minimizing the deviation between the synthetic data and the model. The first case is a separation of rare earth elements by ion-exchange chromatography and the second case is a purification of insulin from a product-related impurity by reversed-phase chromatography. It is shown that normally distributed errors in the concentrations result in deviations in the UV-signal that are not normally distributed. With the applied method, known concentration distributions can be translated into probability distributions of the model parameters, which can be taken into account in the model-based process design.

The surface reflection properties are changing strongly since the steel blocks are partially covered with scale. Due to this fact we abandon intensity imaging and resort to range imaging approaches in particular light sectioning. This provides more reliable surface data. However, a slower acquisition rate and geometric distortions caused by vibrations of the steel block on the conveyor are detriments. We provide an approach for the reconstruction of the 3D surface using geometric transformation. Additionally, we suggest two methods based on spline interpolation and singular value decomposition for recovering the depth map of the inspected good.",

    "abstract": "Most of the physical systems can be represented by mathematical models. The mathematical procedure of system modeling often leads to a comprehensive description of a process in the form of higher-order differential equations which are difficult to use either for analysis or for controller synthesis. It is, therefore, useful and sometimes necessary to find the possibility of some equations of the same type but of lower order that may be considered to adequately reflect almost all essential characteristics of the system under consideration. This paper proposes a new method for order reduction of higher-order linear time invariant systems based on stability equation method and particle swarm optimization algorithm. Reduced-order model will definitely be stable if the original model is stable. The superiority of the proposed method is illustrated by numerical examples of single-input, single-output systems and multiple-input and multiple-output systems. The results are compared with well-known methods available in the literature.",

Even though numerous methods for estimating optical flow have been proposed over the last three decades, a sound, universal, and statistically motivated confidence measure for optical flow measurements is still missing. We aim at filling this gap with this contribution, where such a confidence measure is derived, using statistical test theory and measurable statistics of flow fields from the regarded domain. The new confidence measure is computed from merely the results of the optical flow estimator and hence can be applied to any optical flow estimation method, covering the range from local parametric to global variational approaches. Experimental results using state-of-the-art optical flow estimators and various test sequences demonstrate the superiority of the proposed technique compared to existing 'confidence' measures.",

    "abstract": "Sustainable building has emerged as an important topic due to the fact that it can significantly reduce the impact of buildings and their operation on the natural environment and more efficiently utilize resources throughout a building's life-cycle. When compared with a traditional buildingdesign process, integrated project delivery has proven to be more efficient, and is thus gaining wider acceptance for many sustainable building projects. However, managing design and construction from different disciplines is still challenging. Conflicts among constraints are often not identified at the right design stage, which results in multiple iterations of the design process. In this paper, a novel constrain-driven model that enhances design processes through better management of constraints and thus delivers optimal design solutions with higher energy performance is proposed. Multiple Correspondence Analysis was applied to capture the correlations between different items (parameter-value pairs) and classes (constraints). Meanwhile, it integrated Collaborative Filtering methods and Constraint Satisfaction Problem to train and refine the proposed model. Finally, we have applied our model to a synthetic data sets to demonstrate its performance.",

    "abstract": "We propose a software radio based distributed base station (DBS) architecture which replaces conventional base stations with a cluster of DBS and a central processing station (CPS) which are connected by a high speed data communication network. As most signal processing is carried out in the CPS, the DBS is compact and lightweight, and requires low power for operation, so it can be deployed economically and virtually everywhere. Furthermore, since the radio signals received by different DBS are processed in one CPS, signal combining techniques (SCT) can be employed to improve the reverse link capacity of the 3G UMTS. Analytical expressions for this improvement are derived using the concept of percentage of coverage area with and without the SCT. Complementary computer simulation results for a cdma2000 system have also shown that by employing the SCT, the proposed software radio based DBS architecture can achieve significant reverse link capacity improvement.",

    "abstract": "A technique, recently introduced for visual pattern classification, is successfully applied for classification of human gait based on radar Doppler signatures depicted in the time-frequency domain. It is shown that the proposed classification technique implements steps that, in essence, act on revealing the distinctive Doppler features of the human walking and, as such, allows effective discrimination of various types of human motions characterized by the nature of arm swings. We specifically consider three types of arm motions, namely, free swings, one-arm confined swings, and no-arm swings. The last two arm motions can be indicative of a human carrying objects or a person in stressed situations. The paper explains the different processing stages of motion classification architecture and demonstrates their contributions to the final decision.",

In a multilevel security scenario, where isolation of partitions containing data at different security classifications is the primary security goal and security breaches are mainly defined as undesired disclosure or modification of classified data, strict control of information flows is the ultimate goal. In order to prevent undesired information flows, we provide a classification of information flow types in a component-based operating system and, by this, possible patterns to attack the system. The systematic consideration of informations flows reveals a specific type of operating system covert channel, the covert physical channel, which connects two former isolated partitions by emitting physical signals into the computer's environment and receiving them at another interface.",

    "abstract": "Separation of the text regions from background texture and graphics is an important step of any optical character recognition sytem for the images containg both texts and graphics. In this paper, we have presented a novel text/graphics separation technique for business card images captured with a cell-phone camera. At first, the background is eliminated at a coarse level based on intensity variance. This makes the foreground components distinct from each other. Then the non-text components are removed using various characteristic features of text and graphics. Finally, the text regions are skew corrected and binarized for further processing. Experimenting with business card images of various resolutions, we have found an optimum performance of 98.54% with 0.75 MP images, that takes 0.17 seconds processing time and 1.1 MB peak memory on a moderately powerful computer (DualCore 1.73 GHz Processor, 1 GB RAM, 1 MB L2 Cache). The developed technique is computationally efficient and consumes low memory so as to be applicable on mobile devices.",

The software maps phylogenies annotated with both discrete and continuous spatial information and can export high-dimensional posterior summaries to keyhole markup language (KML) for animation of the spatial diffusion through time in virtual globe software. In addition, SPREAD implements Bayes factor calculation to evaluate the support for hypotheses of historical diffusion among pairs of discrete locations based on Bayesian stochastic search variable selection estimates. SPREAD takes advantage of multicore architectures to process large joint posterior distributions of phylogenies and their spatial diffusion and produces visualizations as compelling and interpretable statistical summaries for the different spatial projections.

    "abstract": "In this paper we present AMGE, a programming framework and runtime system that transparently decomposes GPU kernels and executes them on multiple GPUs in parallel. AMGE exploits the remote memory access capability in modern GPUs to ensure that data can be accessed regardless of its physical location, allowing our runtime to safely decompose and distribute arrays across GPU memories. It optionally performs a compiler analysis that detects array access patterns in GPU kernels. Using this information, the runtime can perform more efficient computation and data distribution configurations than previous works. The GPU execution model allows AMGE to hide the cost of remote accesses if they are kept below 5%. We demonstrate that a thread block scheduling policy that distributes remote accesses through the whole kernel execution further reduces their overhead. Results show 1.98\u00d7 and 3.89\u00d7 execution speedups for 2 and 4 GPUs for a wide range of dense computations compared to the original versions on a single GPU.",

The method discriminates plaque components into four classes: calcium, necrotic core, fibrous and fibro-fatty. We employ the IVUS frames characterized by virtual histology (VH) for tissue labeling. As a result, we avoid the demerits of visual assessments of observers while at the same time the longitudinal resolution of VH is increased. To describe the textural properties of the tissue classes five different features are extracted from IVUS images. The features are computed by using multiple window sizes so that their values are adapted to the varying heterogeneity of the local patterns. In the next stage, we apply an effective feature selection algorithm on the combined feature space of original features, yielding a small subset of discriminating and non-redundant features. The retained features are used for tissue classification via an SVM classifier. The method is validated against the available VH reference data. The experimental results show that the proposed approach achieves an average accuracy of 81%. This result is obtained by a reduced subset comprising 34 features of the appropriate type and scale of extraction.",

He proposed a metameric ordering system of the vertebrate head based on a comparative investigation of selachians. This \u201csegmentation theory of the vertebrate head\u201d had a stimulating effect on comparative anatomy. Traces of the basic ideas are still inherent in the biological sciences. Despite the fact that Carl Gegenbaur proposed a rather phylogenetic approach, his systematic investigations remained on a typological level. It is argued herein, that the reason for that was his inability to perform his comparisons independent of a rather intuitive a priori hypothesis about phylogenetic relationships, thus leaving no possibilities for testing homologies. This is exemplified by Carl Gegenbaur\u2019s choice of species for comparative work as well as his use of these species in comparative work. Choosing species for comparisons is discussed.",

    "abstract": "Object-oriented semantic metrics address software quality by assessing underlying code meaning. Previous metrics were based on mapping a class's semantic information onto concepts in an application domain knowledge base. Quality measurements were made by operating on the concepts mapped onto. In this work, we consider more complex inter-concept relationships\u2014semantic disambiguities through semantic connections. The idea is that a level of ambiguity is indicated by the connectivity within the knowledge base between two concepts. A cohesion metric based on this idea is shown to perform as well as traditional metrics, and is available much earlier in the development cycle.",

    "abstract": "Stratum structure detection is a fundamental problem in geological engineering. One of the most commonly employed detection technologies is to shoot videos of a borehole using a forward moving camera. Using this technology, the problem of stratum structure detection is transformed into the problem of constructing a panoramic image from a low quality video. In this paper, we propose a novel method for creating a panoramic image of a borehole from a video sequence without the need of camera calibration and tracking. To stitch together pixels of neighboring image frames, our camera model is designed with a focal length changing feature, along with a small rotational freedom in the two-dimensional image space. Our camera model assumes that target objects lie on a cylindrical wall and that the camera moves forward along the central axis of the cylindrical wall. Based on these two assumptions, our method robustly resolves these two degrees-of-freedoms in our camera model through KLT feature tracking. Since the quality of the result video is affected by possible illumination overflow, camera lens blurring, and low video resolution, we introduce a cost function for eliminating seams between stitching strips. Our cost function is designed based on Markov Random Field and optimized using a belief propagation algorithm. Using our method, we can automatically construct a panorama image with good resolution, smoothness, and continuousness both in the texture and illumination space. Experiment results show that our method could efficiently generate panoramas for long video sequences with satisfying visual quality.",

    "abstract": "This paper describes and evaluates a computational architecture to discover and collect occurrences of speech repetitions, or motifs, in a totally unsupervised fashion, that is in the absence of acoustic, lexical or pronunciation modeling and training material. In the last few years, this task has known an increasing interest from the speech community because of a) its potential applicability in spoken document processing (as a preliminary step to summarization, topic clustering, etc.) and b) its novel methodology, that defines a new paradigm to speech processing that circumvents the issues common to all supervised, trained technologies. The contributions implied by the proposed system are two-fold: 1) the design of a discovery strategy that detects repetitions by extending matches of motif fragments, called seeds; 2) the implementation of template matching techniques to detect acoustically close segments, based on dynamic time warping (DTW) and self-similarity matrix (SSM) comparison of speech templates, in contrast to the decoding procedures of model-based recognition systems. The architecture is thoroughly evaluated on several hours of French broadcast news shows according to various parameter settings and acoustic features, namely mel-frequency cepstral coefficients (MFCCs) and different types of posteriorgrams: Gaussian mixture model (GMM)-based, and phone-based posteriors, in both language-matched and mismatched conditions. The evaluation highlights a) the improved robustness of the system that jointly employs DTW and SSM and b) the relevant impact of language-specific features to acoustic similarity detection based on template matching.",

It is therefore useful to define a mechanism for embedded devices that will operate in sensor and actuator networks to be remotely (re)configured and to have flexible computation capabilities. We propose such a configuration, reconfiguration, and processing mechanism in the form of a software architecture. A node component should be deployed in any embedded device and implements application programming interface (API), configuration, processing, and communication. The resulting system provides remote configuration and processing of data in any node in a most flexible way, since every node has the same uniform API, processing, and access functionalities.

A CDN may be implemented as an overlay network over existing WANs, or may use its private WAN links. Its purpose is to bring content to the network edges, close to the actual users, as retrieving content from a nearby source usually results in a user experienced quality of service (QoS) being much better compared to retrieving content from sources far away. When distributing the content from one source to several replicating sites (caches), using multicast is much more efficient than using unicast. Here CODIS uses the natural multicasting/broadcasting capabilities of a GEO satellite. We describe the architecture of CODIS, the types of sites producing and storing content, and end-user-focused QoS which has been measured in various experiments.",

It is assumed that the adversary injects additive false information into the sensor measurement. The impact of the false information on the Kalman filter's estimation performance is analyzed for a general dynamic system. To be concrete, a target tracking system has been used as an example. In such a system, if the false information is injected only once, the effect of the false information on the Kalman filter proves to be diminishing over time, even when the Kalman filter is unaware of the false information injection. The convergence rate as a function of the maneuvering index is analyzed. If the false information is repeatedly injected into the system, the induced estimation error proves to reach a finite steady state. Numerical examples are presented to support the theoretical results.",

This paper presents a design of a high performance stereo output system that can be interfaced to a parallel processing environment. The parallel processing environment and interfaces are based around transputers, the stereo processing is based around a Philips SAA7322/SAA7323 CMOS chip.",

    "abstract": "The long-standing identification problem for causal effects in graphical models has many partial results but lacks a systematic study. We show how computer algebra can be used to either prove that a causal effect can be identified, generically identified, or show that the effect is not generically identifiable. We report on the results of our computations for linear structural equation models, where we determine precisely which causal effects are generically identifiable for all graphs on three and four vertices.",

    "abstract": "Interactive decision making arose as a means to overcome the uncertainty concerning the decision maker's (DM) value function. So far the search is confined to nondominated alternatives, which assumes that a win\u2013lose strategy is adopted. The purpose of this paper is to suggest a complementary interactive algorithm that uses an interior point method to solve multiple objective linear programming problems. As the algorithm proceeds, the DM has access to intermediate solutions. The sequence of intermediate solutions has a very interesting characteristic: all of the criteria are improved, that is, a solution Open image in new window, that follows another solution Open image in new window, has the values of all objectives greater than those of Open image in new window. This WIN-WIN feature allows the DM to reach a nondominated solution without making any trade-off among the objective functions. However, there is no impediment in proceeding with traditional multiobjective methods.",

This paper aims at identifying key performance drivers for small and medium\u2010sized companies that sell online (e\u2010SMEs), by empirically examining the impact of resources and capabilities on financial performance and on Internet performance. Regression results of 106 companies showed that resources and capabilities differ in their impact on financial and on Internet performance. Business resources are important predictors of both financial performance and Internet performance. However, dynamic capabilities only affect financial performance (and not Internet performance), and IT resources only drive Internet performance (and not financial performance). The findings have implications for both researchers and practitioners. For researchers the results imply that the choice of the dependent variable can change the main conclusions of a study and, therefore,...",

    "abstract": "We describe a series of five statistical models of the translation process and give algorithms for estimating the parameters of these models given a set of pairs of sentences that are translations of one another. We define a concept of word-by-word alignment between such pairs of sentences. For any given pair of such sentences each of our models assigns a probability to each of the possible word-by-word alignments. We give an algorithm for seeking the most probable of these alignments. Although the algorithm is suboptimal, the alignment thus obtained accounts well for the word-by-word relationships in the pair of sentences. We have a great deal of data in French and English from the proceedings of the Canadian Parliament. Accordingly, we have restricted our work to these two languages; but we feel that because our algorithms have minimal linguistic content they would work well on other pairs of languages. We also feel, again because of the minimal linguistic content of our algorithms, that it is reasonable to argue that word-by-word alignments are inherent in any sufficiently large bilingual corpus.",

A novel approach for the fast and reliable detection and characterization of abnormal events in crowd motions is proposed, based on particle advection and accurate optical flow estimation. Experiments on benchmark datasets show that changes are detected reliably and faster than existing methods. Also, regions of change are localized spatially, and the events occurring in the video are characterized with accuracy.",

    "abstract": "TCP traffic that enters an IP network that supports Differentiated Services, is policed packet by packet. The border router marks differently those packets that are conforming to the Commited Information Rate (CIR) and those that are in excess and, therefore, non-conforming. The latter packets have a higher probability of being dropped in the buffers both of the border router and of the core router. This behavior has an implication when TCP sources are present. The TCP congestion control mechanism adapts the source rate to a speed that depends on the packet drop probability; therefore, in case of congestion, not only the excess traffic is dropped, but the TCP source is made to work at a speed that is even lower than the contracted CIR. In this paper, we propose a mechanism capable of controlling the amount of excess traffic that is allowed to enter the DiffServ network in a way that, even in case of congestion, the TCP throughput is not lower than the CIR.",

VIPR is an attempt to bring the traditional strengths of textual imperative languages to a visual programming language. It leverages these strengths to make use of well-understood design and abstraction methodologies while providing additional visual features, such as explicit representations, contextual information, and execution animation. VIPR uses these strengths and features to address the quasi-real-time problem posed by the VPC, whose requirements include interaction with the low-level vehicle manipulation code, map exploration and display, as well as additional requirements such as flexibility of solution and performance demands. Our solution does not directly address pedagogical issues or the value of VIPR's simple graphical semantics. It did point out weaknesses with VIPR's approach to solving the scalability problem in visual programming languages.",

    "abstract": "In modern organizations, decision makers must often be able to quickly access information from diverse sources in order to make timely decisions. A critical problem facing many such organizations is the inability to easily reconcile the information contained in heterogeneous data sources. To overcome this limitation, an organization must resolve several types of heterogeneity problems that may exist across different sources. We examine one such problem called the entity heterogeneity problem, which arises when the same real-world entity type is represented using different identifiers in different applications. A decision-theoretic model to resolve the problem is proposed. Our model uses a distance measure to express the similarity between two entity instances. We have implemented the model and tested it on real-world data. The results indicate that the model performs quite well in terms of its ability to predict whether two entity instances should be matched or not. The model is shown to be computationally efficient. It also scales well to large relations from the perspective of the accuracy of prediction. Overall, the test results imply that this is certainly a viable approach in practical situations.",

    "abstract": "This paper examines the problem of scheduling two-machine no-wait job shops to minimize makespan. The problem is known to be strongly NP-hard. A two-phase heuristic is developed to solve the problem. Phase 1 of the heuristic transforms the problem into a no-wait flow shop problem and solves it using the well known Gilmore and Gomory algorithm. Phase 2 of the heuristic improves the solution obtained in phase 1 using a simple tabu search algorithm. Computational results show that the proposed heuristic performs extremely well in terms of both solution quality and computation time. It finds an optimal solution to about 90% of the problem instances and the average deviation from the lower bond for the other problem instances is infinitesimal.",

Two different approaches are proposed to reduce the resolution complexity of the theory of regions by minimizing the total number of equations in its linear system. These two approaches are based on a new concept of minimal cuts in reachability graph. The supervisor is a Petri net controller for each minimal cut. Moving from one control place to another allows the switch of minimal cuts in the reachability graph. These new approaches allows also to determine a Petri net controller when it doesn't exist using the classical approach of the theory of regions. To illustrate the present methods an application is implemented on the Flexible Manufacturing System (FMS) at the ENIM (National school of engineering of Metz) in FRANCE.",

However, situation models in real-world applications are typically complex and not easy to use. This paper presents a Context-aware Decision Support (CaDS) system, which consists of a situation model for shared situation awareness modelling and a group of entity agents, one for each individual user, for focused and customized decision support. By incorporating a rule-based inference engine, the entity agents provide functions including event classification, action recommendation, and proactive decision making. The implementation and the performance of the proposed system are demonstrated through a case study on a simulated command and control application.",

The paper presents the basic theory of angular 2-structures and, in particular, the theory of  primitive  angular 2-structures. We demonstrate that the notion of an angular 2-structure is a well-chosen generalization of the notions of a symmetric graph and a partial order.",

The authors present a foundation for force control strategies, in view of the fact that the type of control strategy that is employed depends fundamentally on the characteristics of the environment. A general control approach is introduced, called hybrid impedance control which in its simplest forms reduces the operational space control of O. Khatib and J. Burdick (1986), or to N. Hogan's (1985) impedance control. The control law is formulated in a general enough fashion, however, to allow for higher order controllers. >",

A model and several variations are presented, and it is shown that the main problem consists of a number of complicating constraints.

Learning rate and neighborhood sizes are also replaced by the clonal selection process used in AIS. This new network is called TAISOM. Experimental results with TAISOM are implemented for uniform and Gaussian distributions for one and two-dimensional lattices of neurons.

    "abstract": "Content-related metadata plays an important role in the eort of developing intelligent web applications. One of the most established form of providing contentrelated metadata is the assignment of web-pages to content categories. We describe the Spectacle system for classifying individual web pages on the basis of their syntactic structure. This classification requires the specification of classification rules associating common page structures with predefined classes. In this paper, we propose an approach for the automatic acquisition of these classification rules using techniques from inductive logic programming and describe experiments in applying the approach to an existing web-based information system.",

    "abstract": "Forest fires lead to high amount of environmental and economic loss all over the world. Prevention and early detection efforts aim to eliminate or minimize the damage that will be caused by a fire incident. Current surveillance systems for forest fires do not provide dense real-time monitoring and hence they lack prevention or early detection of a fire threat. Wireless sensor networks (WSNs), on the other hand, can collect real-time information such as temperature and humidity from almost all points of a forest and can provide fresh and accurate data for the fire-fighting management center quickly. In this work, we aim to evaluate the reporting performance of a WSN under realistic workload. Since fires are destructive and burning a deployed WSN is not feasible, simulation is the appropriate way to assess the reporting capability of a WSN during a forest fire. We integrate WSN simulator with a realistic fire propagation simulator which is modified to provide time based temperature field information while the fire propagates through the deployment area. Temperature information is used for the generation of realistic workloads and the determination of sensor destruction times that affects the routing decisions in WSN simulations. We present the effects of WSN related factors; such as reporting rate, number of the sinks, and the sink locations together with the effects of environmental factors such as the wind speed and the number of ignition points in terms of temperature reporting performance and freshness of temperature map.",

Stakeholders were identified, and semi-structured one-to-one interviews were carried out in order to identify issues deemed most important to each group.

At the time of the study, the company was undergoing significant change related to a shift in organizational strategic priority, resulting in a complex research environment that required a clear research question, data collection design, and expectations for research outcomes. First, researchers assisted practitioners in formulating a method of inquiry to describe existing portfolio management processes. Then, researchers framed the analysis of findings to recommend strategies for maturing the portfolio management processes in light of existing governance structures, established practices, and cultural values. The research design and theoretical framing used to arrive at the recommendations not only enhance the internal validity of findings, but are presented as an important strength in this instance of collaborative research and suggested as a model for future similar collaborations.",

The problem, Ballantyne argues, lies in what is commonly thought to be a necessary condition for luck\u2014a significance or value condition (Pritchard, in Epistemic luck, 2005; Coffman, in Synthese 15(3):385\u2013398, 2007; Lackey, in Austral J Philos 86(2):255\u2013267, 2008, Ballantyne, in Can J Philos 41(4):485\u2013503, 2011). For an event, like forming a true belief, to be lucky then it must be of some significance or value to an agent. Yet, if significance, as it has also been commonly thought, plays a role in determining the degree of luck (Pritchard and Smith, in New Ideas Psychol 22:1\u201328, 2004; Ballantyne, in Can J Philos 41(4):485\u2013503, 2011), then this leads to a result similar to (but not the same as) an absurd form of pragmatic encroachment. If this problem cannot be avoided, then anti-luck epistemology should be abandoned. However, this paper will argue that with proper considerations about the nature of luck according to at least one theory, no such problem arises.",

The survey was sent to 1245 Belgian and 1450 Dutch companies with 50 employees or more, resulting in a response rate of 9%. Statistical analysis of the result demonstrate that although the development of crisis management plans leads to a higher awareness of the company risks, it is especially the creation of a crisis management team that leads to a higher degree of actions taken, for instance training or simulations. Moreover, this study demonstrates that the level of IT use in crisis management is predominantly related to the presence of a member in the crisis management team with an IT background",

    "abstract": "Advances in miniaturization will allow for the commoditization of large numbers of tiny satellites, known as \"CubeSats.\" However, current algorithms made for small tightly-managed space missions are ill-designed to take advantage of the huge amount of resources available in a decentralized collection of these CubeSats. We believe that multiagent evolutionary algorithms are ideally suited to exploit the distributed nature of this new problem. This paper presents a solution where a customer in need of satellite observations can reliably obtain these observations at low cost, through the help of a multiagent system as an intermediary. Each agent in this system is assigned to a single CubeSat. Given a set of the customer's observational needs, and models of the CubeSats' salient properties, the agents evolve policies that attempt to purchase an appropriate set of observations at a low price. This system is especially flexible as it demands no centralized resource broker, contracts or commitments of resources. We perform a series of experiments on an Earth-observition domain. The results show that the evolutionary methods combined with multiagent techniques have three times the performance of a simple hand-coded allocation algorithm, and twice the performance of simple evolving agents.",

Although equally distantly related to humans, the ancestors of vervets diverged from those of macaques and baboons more than 11 million years ago, antedating the divergence of the ancestors of humans, chimpanzees and gorillas. To facilitate anatomic localization in the vervet brain, two linked on-line electronic atlases are described, one based on registered MRI scans from hundreds of vervets (  http://www.loni.ucla.edu/Research/Atlases/Data/vervet/vervetmratlas/vervetmratlas.html  ) and the other based on a high-resolution cryomacrotome study of a single vervet (  http://www.loni.ucla.edu/Research/Atlases/Data/vervet/vervetatlas/vervetatlas.html  ). The averaged MRI atlas is also available as a volume in Neuroimaging Informatics Technology Initiative format. In the cryomacrotome atlas, various sulcal and subcortical structures have been anatomically labeled and surface rendered views are provided along the primary planes of section. Both atlases simultaneously provide views in all three primary planes of section, rapid navigation by clicking on the displayed images, and stereotaxic coordinates in the averaged MRI atlas space. Despite the extended time period since their divergence, the major sulcal and subcortical landmarks in vervets are highly conserved relative to those described in macaques.",

    "abstract": "Routing in wireless networks has been heavily studied in the last decade. Many routing protocols are based on classic shortest path algorithms. However, shortest path-based routing protocols suffer from uneven load distribution in the network, such as crowed center effect where the center nodes have more load than the nodes in the periphery. Aiming to balance the load, we propose a novel routing method, called Circular Sailing Routing (CSR), which can distribute the traffic more evenly in the network. The proposed method first maps the network onto a sphere via a simple stereographic projection, and then the route decision is made by a newly defined \"circular distance\" on the sphere instead of the Euclidean distance in the plane. We theoretically prove that for a network, the distance traveled by the packets using CSR is no more than a small constant factor of the minimum (the distance of the shortest path). We also extend CSR to a localized version, Localized CSR, by modifying greedy routing without any additional communication overhead. In addition, we investigate how to design CSR routing for 3D networks. For all proposed methods, we conduct extensive simulations to study their performances and compare them with global shortest path routing or greedy routing in 2D and 3D wireless networks.",

When only the output is available, pole assignment is still possible by means of dynamic output feedback. In this paper the potential of time-varying memoryless output feedback is considered. It is shown that, up to some technical conditions, it is indeed possible to allocate the poles of a linear time-invariant discrete-time system by memoryless output feedback with periodic gains. The period of the gains is (n + 1) with n the order of the system. The power of the design technique is proved to be comparable to what can be achieved by the classical dynamic feedback approach.",

    "abstract": "Transmission opportunities in delay- and disruption-tolerant networks (DTNs) may be scarce and short-lived. In consequence, the fragmentation of larger messages at intermediate nodes is an important requirement to efficiently utilize any available connectivity. At the same time, bandwidth must be protected against any unauthorized transmission attempt, which implies that source authentication mechanisms are needed. However, naive solutions for supporting both message fragmentation and authentication are inefficient in terms of bandwidth or computational requirements. The problem has been clearly identified in the literature and various solutions have been suggested, but a systematic treatment of the problem has not been carried out so far. In this work, we approach the problem of authenticated fragmentation by rephrasing it as a multicast authentication problem. We identify a number of computationally efficient multicast authentication protocols that are suitable for DTN scenarios and highlight known computational or bandwidth optimality results for two classes of solutions. We generalize the remaining protocols into a single third class and provide a theoretical analysis, which proves the bandwidth optimality of a protocol that has been independently suggested for the authenticated fragmentation problem. We extend the setting of the protocol by considering a network scenario where neighboring nodes can communicate reliably and show theoretically that in this scenario the amortized bandwidth overhead converges to the minimum possible. Finally, we review a number of approaches presented in the literature on the authenticated fragmentation problem and outline their inadequacies.",

    "abstract": "With the popularity of wireless devices and the increase of computing and storage resources, there are increasing interests in supporting mobile computing techniques. Particularly, ad hoc networks can potentially connect different wireless devices to enable more powerful wireless applications and mobile computing capabilities. To meet the ever increasing communication need, it is important to improve the network throughput while guaranteeing transmission reliability. Multiple-input-multiple-output (MIMO) technology can provide significantly higher data rate in ad hoc networks where nodes are equipped with multi-antenna arrays. Although MIMO technique itself can support diversity transmission when channel condition degrades, the use of diversity transmission often compromises the multiplexing gain and is also not enough to deal with extremely weak channel. Instead, in this work, we exploit the use of cooperative relay transmission (which is often used in a single antenna environment to improve reliability) in a MIMO-based ad hoc network to cope with harsh channel condition. We design both centralized and distributed scheduling algorithms to support adaptive use of cooperative relay transmission. Our algorithm effectively exploits the cooperative multiplexing gain and cooperative diversity gain to achieve higher data rate and higher reliability under various channel conditions. Our scheduling scheme can efficiently invoke relay transmission without introducing significant signaling overhead as conventional relay schemes, and seamlessly integrate relay transmission with multiplexed MIMO transmission. We also design a MAC protocol to implement the distributed algorithm. Our performance results demonstrate that the use of cooperative relay in a MIMO framework could bring in a significant throughput improvement in all the scenarios studied, with the variation of node density, link failure ratio, packet arrival rate and retransmission threshold.",

    "abstract": "Digital watermarking has become an important technique for copyright protection, and various watermarking schemes have been proposed. Singular Value Decomposition (SVD) has been used as a valuable transform technique for robust digital watermarking due to some superior characteristics not obtained by DCT, DFT or DWT. In this paper, we present a new robust hybrid image watermarking scheme based on SVD and DCT. After applying SVD to the cover image blocks, we perform DCT on the macro block comprised of the first singular values (SVs) of each image block. We also developed a new method to embed the watermark in the high-frequency band of the SVD-DCT block by imposing a particular relationship between some pseudo-randomly selected pairs of the DCT coefficients. Experimental results show that the proposed watermarking method performs better than state-of-the-art SVD-based methods, and is comparable with the state-of-art wavelet-based robust image watermarking method.",

The videophone service is implemented according to H.261 standard. The concept of dynamic boundary is adopted in both code and time domains to meet the different requirements for videophone, voice and data traffic. Two mathematical analysis methods are adopted to evaluate the system performance. One is the traditional Markov analysis (TDMA), which is used to calculate the average videophone and voice call blocking probabilities. The other is Transient Fluid Analysis (TFA), which is adopted to evaluate the data delay and channel utilization performance. Results show that two dynamic boundaries can be adjusted to achieve the optimal system performance, and suggestions of how to adjust these boundaries are also given.",

    "abstract": "Complex social and information network search becomes important with a variety of applications. In the core of these applications, lies a common and critical problem: Given a labeled network and a query graph, how to efficiently search the query graph in the target network. The presence of noise and the incomplete knowledge about the structure and content of the target network make it unrealistic to find an exact match. Rather, it is more appealing to find the top-k approximate matches.   In this paper, we propose a neighborhood-based similarity measure that could avoid costly graph isomorphism and edit distance computation. Under this new measure, we prove that subgraph similarity search is NP hard, while graph similarity match is polynomial. By studying the principles behind this measure, we found an information propagation model that is able to convert a large network into a set of multidimensional vectors, where sophisticated indexing and similarity search algorithms are available. The proposed method, called Ness (Neighborhood Based Similarity Search), is appropriate for graphs with low automorphism and high noise, which are common in many social and information networks. Ness is not only efficient, but also robust against structural noise and information loss. Empirical results show that it can quickly and accurately find high-quality matches in large networks, with negligible cost.",

    "abstract": "This paper studies the classic linear quadratic regulation (LQR) problem for both continuous-time and discrete-time systems with multiple input delays. For discrete-time systems, the LQR problem for systems with single input delay has been studied in existing literature, whereas a solution to the multiple input delay case is not known to our knowledge. For continuous-time systems with multiple input delays, the LQR problem has been tackled via an infinite dimensional system theory approach and a frequency/time domain approach. The objective of the present paper is to give an explicit solution to the LQR problem via a simple and intuitive approach. The main contributions of the paper include a fundamental result of duality between the LQR problem for systems with multiple input delays and a smoothing problem for an associated backward stochastic system. The duality allows us to obtain a solution to the LQR problem via standard projection in linear space. The LQR controller is simply constructed by the solution of one backward Riccati difference (for the discrete-time case) or differential (for the continuous-time case) equation of the same order as the plant (ignoring the delays).",

    "abstract": "As part of the face recognition task in a robust security system, we propose a novel approach for the illumination recovery of faces with cast shadows and specularities. Given a single 2D face image, we relight the face object by extracting the nine spherical harmonic bases and the face spherical illumination coefficients by using the face spherical spaces properties. First, an illumination training database is generated by computing the properties of the spherical spaces out of face albedo and normal values estimated from 2D training images. The training database is then discriminately divided into two directions in terms of the illumination quality and light direction of each image. Based on the generated multi-level illumination discriminative training space, we analyze the target face pixels and compare them with the appropriate training subspace using pre-generated tiles. When designing the framework, practical real-time processing speed and small image size were considered. In contrast to other approaches, our technique requires neither 3D face models nor restricted illumination conditions for the training process. Furthermore, the proposed approach uses one single face image to estimate the face albedo and face spherical spaces. In this work, we also provide the results of a series of experiments performed on publicly available databases to show the significant improvements in the face recognition rates.",

    "abstract": "Many real world optimization problems involve uncertainties. A solution for such a problem is expected to be robust to these uncertainties. Commonly, robustness is attained by choosing the solution\u2019s parameters such that the solution\u2019s performance is less influenced by negative effects of the uncertain parameters\u2019 variations. This robustness may be viewed as a passive robustness, because once the solution\u2019s parameters are chosen, the robustness is inherent in the solution and no further action, to suppress the effect of uncertainties, is expected. However, it is acknowledged that enhanced robustness comes on the expense of peak performances. In this study, Active Robust Optimization is presented as a new robust optimization approach. It considers products that are able to adapt to environmental changes. The enhanced robustness of these solutions is attained by adaptation, which reduces the loss in performance due to environmental changes. A new optimization problem named Active Robust Optimization Problem is formulated. The problem amalgamates robust optimization with dynamic optimization in order to evaluate the performance of a candidate solution, while considering possible environmental conditions. Adaptation\u2019s influence on the solution\u2019s performance and cost is considered as well. Hence, the problem is formulated as a multiobjective problem that simultaneously aims at low costs and high performance. Since these goals are commonly in conflict: the solution is a set of optimal adaptive solutions. An evolutionary algorithm is proposed in order to evolve this set. An example of optimizing an adaptive optical table is provided. It is shown that an adaptive product, which is an outcome of the suggested approach, may be superior to an equivalent product that is not adaptive.",

    "abstract": "The goal of the work presented here is to influence the overall behaviour of specific animal societies by integrating computational mechatronic devices (robots) into those societies. To do so, these devices should be accepted by the animals aspart of the society and/or as part of the collectively formed environment. For that, we have developed two sets of robotic hardware for integrating into societies of two different animals: zebra fish and young honeybees. We also developed mechanisms to provide feedback from the behaviours of societies for the controllers of the robotic system. Two different computational methods are then used as the controllers of the robots in simulation and successfully adapted by evolutionary algorithms to influence the simulated animals for desired behaviours. Together, these advances in mechatronic hardware, feedback mechanisms, and controller methodology are laying essential foundations to facilitate experiments on modulating self-organised behaviour in mixed animal -- robot societies.",

An adaptation of reference trajectories connected with a hybrid discrete continuous control architecture allows stable grasps even if moving fingers cannot contact at the desired position on a grasped object.

In this paper, the performance of a GMM-UBM based speaker verification system on emotional speech is studied. It is found that speech with various emotions aggravates the verification performance. Two reasons for the performance aggravation are analyzed, they are mismatched emotions between the speaker models and the test utterances, and the articulating styles of certain emotions which create intense intra-speaker vocal variability. In response to the first reason, an emotion-dependent score normalization method is proposed, which is borrowed from the idea of Hnorm. Index Terms: speaker verification, emotional speech",

    "abstract": "Importance measures are used in reliability engineering to rank the system components according to their contributions to proper functioning of the entire system and to find the most effective ways of reliability enhancement. Traditionally, the importance measures do not consider the possible change of system structure with the improvement of specific component reliability. However, if a component\u05f3s reliability changes, the optimal system structure/configuration may also change and the importance of the corresponding component will depend on the chosen structure. When the most promising component reliability improvement is determined, the component importance should be taken into account with respect to the possible structure changes. This paper studies the component reliability importance indices with respect to the changes of the optimal component sequencing. This importance measure indicates the critical components in providing the system reliability enhancement by both enhancing the component\u05f3s reliability and reconfiguring the system. Examples of linear consecutive- k -out-of- n : F and G systems are considered to demonstrate the change of the component Birnbaum importance with the optimal system reconfiguration. The results show that the change of the importance index corresponds to the change of the system optimal configuration and the importance index can change not monotonically with the variation of the component reliability.",

We conducted a study on multiple password interference in graphical passwords and examined the effects on users' behaviour and performance. DAS, PassPoints and PassFaces, three canonical graphical passwords, represent the three main memory categories: recall, cued-recall and recognition. PassPoints were divided into PassPoints-I and PassPoints-II, corresponding to associated and unassociated cued-recall memory respectively. The study results indicate that the multiple password interference exercises strong impacts in PassFaces and is significant in DAS and PassPoints-II only in the long-term memory, while has no impact in PassPoints-I. From psychological analysis, it is clear that recall-based, recognition-based and associated cued-recall-based schemes are all susceptible to multiple password interference to some extent, while unassociated cued-recall based is not subject to memory password interference.",

Yet, especially in the visual periphery, a range of non-zero vertical disparities do occur and can influence perception. It has therefore been assumed that primary visual cortex must contain neurons tuned to a range of vertical disparities. Here, I show that this is not necessarily the case. Many disparity-selective neurons are most sensitive to changes in disparity orthogonal to their preferred orientation. That is, the disparity tuning surfaces, mapping their response to different two-dimensional (2D) disparities, are elongated along the cell's preferred orientation. Because of this, even if a neuron's optimal 2D disparity has zero vertical component, the neuron will still respond best to a non-zero vertical disparity when probed with a sub-optimal horizontal disparity. This property can be used to decode 2D disparity, even allowing for realistic levels of neuronal noise. Even if all V1 neurons at a particular retinotopic location are tuned to the expected vertical disparity there (for example, zero at the fovea), the brain could still decode the magnitude and sign of departures from that expected value. This provides an intriguing counter-example to the common wisdom that, in order for a neuronal population to encode a quantity, its members must be tuned to a range of values of that quantity. It demonstrates that populations of disparity-selective neurons encode much richer information than previously appreciated. It suggests a possible strategy for the brain to extract rarely-occurring stimulus values, while concentrating neuronal resources on the most commonly-occurring situations.",

    "abstract": "Many applications often require finding a set of items of interest with respect to some aggregation constraints. For example, a tourist might want to find a set of places of interest to visit in a city such that the total expected duration is no more than six hours and the total cost is minimized. We refer to such queries as SAC queries for ``set-based with aggregation constraints'' queries. The usefulness of SAC queries is evidenced by the many variations of SAC queries that have been studied which differ in the number and types of constraints supported. In this paper, we make two contributions to SAC query evaluation. We first establish the hardness of evaluating SAC queries with multiple count constraints and presented a novel, pseudo-polynomial time algorithm for evaluating a non-trivial fragment of SAC queries with multiple sum constraints and at most one of either count, group-by, or content constraint. We also propose a heuristic approach for evaluating general SAC queries. The effectiveness of our proposed solutions is demonstrated by an experimental performance study.",

    "abstract": "Noninvasive cardiac electrophysiological imaging aims to mathematically reconstruct the spatio-temporal dynamics of cardiac current sources from body-surface electrocardiography data. This ill-posed problem is often regularized by imposing a certain constraining model on the solution. However, it enforces the source distribution to follow a pre-assumed spatial structure that does not always match the spatio-temporal changes of current sources. We propose a Bayesian approach for 3D current source estimation that consists of a continuous combination of multiple models, each reflecting a specific spatial property for current sources. Multiple models are incorporated into our Bayesian approach as an Lp-norm prior for current sources, where p is an unknown hyperparameter with prior probabilistic distribution defined over the range between 1 and 2. The current source estimation is then obtained as an optimally weighted combination of solutions across all models, the weight being determined from posterior distribution of p inferred from electrocardiography data. The performance of our proposed approach is assessed in a set of synthetic and real-data experiments on human heart-torso models. While the use of fixed models such as L1- and L2-norm only properly recovers sources with specific spatial structures, our method delivers consistent performance in reconstructing sources with different extents and structures.",

The FCA lattice diagrams facilitate the design of a role-based web interface by contributing to the analysis of relationships between roles, functionalities, and database access actions. As a result, they help identifying privileges that are needed by each role to perform required functionalities and page partials and views as web interface components. Additionally, the relabeled FCA lattices direct developers in adding privilege checks in the page partial or view components to help implement the desired access control architecture. The FCA based approach is demonstrated in the development of MIMI, a Multi-modality, Multi-resource, Information Integration environment for the NCI-designated Case Comprehensive Cancer Center (Case CCC). We present the resulting hierarchical lattice diagrams and show that the FCA-based approach benefits the life-cycle development process for MIMI's complex web interface.",

Interactive maps may overcome these limitations. However, usability of these two types of maps had never been compared. It is then unknown whether interactive maps are equivalent or even better solutions than traditional raised-line maps. This study presents a comparison of usability of a classical raised-line map vs. an interactive map composed by a multi-touch screen, a raised-line overlay and audio output. Both maps were tested by 24 blind participants. We measured usability as efficiency, effectiveness and satisfaction. Our results show that replacing braille with simple audio-tactile interaction significantly improved efficiency and user satisfaction. Effectiveness was not related to the map type but depended on users' characteristics as well as the category of assessed spatial knowledge. Long-term evaluation of acquired spatial information revealed that maps, whether interactive or not, are useful to build robust survey-type mental representations in blind users. Altogether, these results are encouraging as they show that interactive maps are a good solution for improving map exploration and cognitive mapping in visually impaired people.",

Regarding the characteristics of human's foot skin, first we develop a measuring equipment to measure the human's plantar transverse elasticity. We set the target value of the modulus of transverse elasticity of the foot skin to 11.2 N/mm, and we set the modulus of compression elasticity to 0.136 MPa, referring to a relevant study. The characteristics of human's foot skin are mimicked by using a super-soft urethane resin called Hitohada-gel with 8 mm thick.

    "abstract": "This correspondence investigates the interplay between cooperation and achievable rates in multiterminal networks. Cooperation refers to the process of nodes working together to relay data toward the destination. There is an inherent tradeoff between achievable information transmission rates and the level of cooperation, which is determined by how many nodes are involved and how the nodes encode/decode the data. We illustrate this tradeoff by studying information-theoretic decode-forward-based coding strategies for data transmission in multiterminal networks. Decode-forward strategies are usually discussed in the context of omniscient coding, in which all nodes in the network fully cooperate with each other, both in encoding and decoding. In this correspondence, we investigate myopic coding, in which each node cooperates with only a few neighboring nodes. We show that achievable rates of myopic decode-forward can be as large as that of omniscient decode-forward in the low signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) regime. We also show that when each node has only a few cooperating neighbors, adding one node into the cooperation increases the transmission rate significantly. Furthermore, we show that myopic decode-forward can achieve nonzero rates as the network size grows without bound.",

    "abstract": "Experimental evidence suggests that the maintenance of an item in working memory is achieved through persistent activity in selective neural assemblies of the cortex. To understand the mechanisms underlying this phenomenon, it is essential to investigate how persistent activity is affected by external inputs or neuromodulation. We have addressed these questions using a recurrent network model of object working memory. Recurrence is dominated by inhibition, although persistent activity is generated through recurrent excitation in small subsets of excitatory neurons.#R##N##R##N#Our main findings are as follows. (1) Because of the strong feedback inhibition, persistent activity shows an inverted U shape as a function of increased external drive to the network. (2) A transient external excitation can switch off a network from a selective persistent state to its spontaneous state. (3) The maintenance of the sample stimulus in working memory is not affected by intervening stimuli (distractors) during the delay period, provided the stimulation intensity is not large. On the other hand, if stimulation intensity is large enough, distractors disrupt sample-related persistent activity, and the network is able to maintain a memory only of the last shown stimulus. (4) A concerted modulation of GABA A and NMDA conductances leads to a decrease of spontaneous activity but an increase of persistent activity; the enhanced signal-to-noise ratio is shown to increase the resistance of the network to distractors. (5) Two mechanisms are identified that produce an inverted U shaped dependence of persistent activity on modulation. The present study therefore points to several mechanisms that enhance the signal-to-noise ratio in working memory states. These mechanisms could be implemented in the prefrontal cortex by dopaminergic projections from the midbrain.",

    "abstract": "Stencil computation is a performance critical kernel used in scientific and engineering applications. We define a term of locality of computation to guide stencil optimization by either architecture or compiler. Being analogous to locality of reference, computational behavior is also classified into spatial locality and temporal locality. This paper develops equivalent computation elimination (ECE) approach in multi-level loop for exploiting temporal locality of computation. The strength of ECE lies on an intermediate-based searching algorithm to eliminate inter-iteration computational redundancies of all possible combination and a multiple dimensions replacement algorithm to replace redundant computation across loops of multiple dimensions. We implemented ECE in ROSE compiler infrastructure. The experiment shows that ECE improves performance by 20% on average due to the consciousness of temporal locality.",

    "abstract": "We consider the problem of  pipelined filters , where a continuous stream of tuples is processed by a set of commutative filters. Pipelined filters are common in stream applications and capture a large class of multiway stream joins. We focus on the problem of ordering the filters adaptively to minimize processing cost in an environment where stream and filter characteristics vary unpredictably over time. Our core algorithm,  A-Greedy  (for  Adaptive Greedy ), has strong theoretical guarantees: If stream and filter characteristics were to stabilize, A-Greedy would converge to an ordering within a small constant factor of optimal. (In experiments A-Greedy usually converges to the optimal ordering.) One very important feature of A-Greedy is that it monitors and responds to selectivities that are correlated across filters (i.e., that are nonindependent), which provides the strong quality guarantee but incurs run-time overhead. We identify a three-way tradeoff among provable convergence to good orderings, run-time overhead, and speed of adaptivity. We develop a suite of variants of A-Greedy that lie at different points on this tradeoff spectrum. We have implemented all our algorithms in the STREAM prototype Data Stream Management System and a thorough performance evaluation is presented.",

This increases the importance and need for non-technical users to be able to search for such information using a simple keyword search. Researchers have studied and addressed some of the issues with the efficiency and effectiveness of answering keyword queries in relational databases. In this paper we have summarized different factors affecting the effectiveness of the keyword search in relational databases which were studied in the early works. We have also identified two other important factors, namely keywords proximity and keywords N-grams that can further improve the search effectiveness when incorporated in the existing state-of-the-art information retrieval relevance ranking strategies for relational databases. Our experiments show that applying these two factors to the current ranking functions will improve the effectiveness of keyword search in relational databases.",

We present a competitive economical system including dynamic algorithms for joining and leaving in which a number of services are provided to the users by a number of origin servers. Each offered service can be considered as a commodity and the servers and the users who relay the services to their downstream nodes can thus be considered as producers of the economy. Also, the users can be viewed as consumers in the economy. On joining to the network, each user is provided with a budget and tries to get hold of the services. We use Walrasian equilibrium to show existence of market-clearing prices. The system is proved to be scalable and experimental results confirm that our proposed mechanism works near-optimal.",

In this scenario, it is clear that it will be impossible to achieve both optimal setpoint tracking and load disturbance attenuation. However, it would be desirable to possess a simple methodology to adjust a convenient Servo/Regulator tradeoff. This paper presents a simple analytical robust PID design aimed at stable plants. Its distinguishing feature is that two design parameters allow easy adjustment of the Robustness/Performance as well as the Servo/Regulator tradeoffs. The resulting unified design extends some previous approaches where only one of the aforementioned tradeoffs is considered.",

    "abstract": "The data on which a MLP (multilayer perceptron) is normally trained to approximate a continuous function may include inputs that are categorical in addition to the numeric or quantitative inputs. Examples of categorical variables are gender, race, and so on. An approach examined in this article is to train a hybrid network consisting of a MLP and an encoder with multiple output units; that is, a separate output unit for each of the various combinations of values of the categorical variables. Input to the feed forward subnetwork of the hybrid network is then restricted to truly numerical quantities. A MLP with connection matrices that multiply input values and sigmoid functions that further transform values represents a continuous mapping in all input variables. A MLP therefore requires that all inputs correspond to numeric, continuously valued variables and represents a continuous function in all input variables. A categorical variable, on the other hand, produces a discontinuous relationship between an input variable and the output. The way that this problem is often dealt with is to replace the categorical values by numeric ones and treat them as if they were continuously valued. However there is no meaningful correspondence between the continuous quantities generated this way and the original categorical values. The basic difficulty with using these variables is that they define a metric for the categories that may not be reasonable. This suggests that the categorical inputs should be segregated from the continuous inputs as explained above. Results show that the method utilizing a hybrid network and separating numerical from quantitative input, as discussed here, is quite effective. \u00a9 2004 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

    "abstract": "The beginning of this work is the achievement of a design tool, which is a multiple model software called \" CODYRUN \", suitable for professionnals and usable by researchers. The original aspect of this software is that the designer has at his disposal a wide panel of choices between different heat transfer models More precisely, it consists in a multizone software integrating both natural ventilation and moisture tranfers . This software is developed on PC micro computer and gets advantage of the Microsoft WINDOWS front-end. Most of time, HVAC systems and specially domestic air conditioners, are taken into account in a very simplified way, or in a elaborated one. On one side,they are just supposed to supply the demand of cooling loads with an ideal control loop (no delay between the sollicitations and the time response of the system), The available outputs are initially the hourly cooling and heating consumptions without integrating the real caracteristics of the HVAC system This paper is also following the same multiple model approach than for the building modelling by defining different modelling levels for the air conditionning systems, from a very simplified one to a detailled one. An experimental validation is achieved in order to compare the sensitivity of each defined model and to point out the interaction between the thermal behaviour of the envelop and the electrical system consumption. For validation purposes, we will describe the data acquisition system. and the used real size test cell located in the University of Reunion island, Indian Ocean.",

We show that better performances are achieved by the implicit methods due both to higher exploitation of hardware capabilities and to the lower communication costs. A BSP performance model of all the algorithms has been built and the predictions obtained have been compared with the results of measurements on two different parallel systems: a cluster of workstations and a shared memory multiprocessor machine. The implicit algorithms have proved to be from 20% to 40% faster than their traditional counterparts. The high accuracy of prediction makes the BSP programming paradigm an ideal framework for developing parallel algorithms.",

We develop an experimental quadruped robot especially designed for dynamic walking. Unlike dog-like robots, the prototype robot looks like a four-legged spider. As an experimental robot, we focus on the three basic concepts: lightweight, wide range of motion and ease of maintenance. To achieve these goals, we introduce a wire-driven mechanism using a synthetic fiber to transmit power to each axis making use of this wire-driven mechanism, we can locate the motors at the base of the leg, reducing, consequently, its inertia. Additionally, each part of the robot is unitized, and can be easily disassembled. As a dynamic walking algorithm, we proposed what we call \u201clongitudinal acceleration trajectory\u201d. This trajectory was applied to intermittent trot gait. The algorithm was tested with the developed robot, and its performance was confirmed through experiments.",

    "abstract": "Cognitive Radio (CR) technology allows an opportunistic use of the licensed spectrum by the CR users, avoiding harmful interference to Primary Users (PUs). To perform their activity, secondary users (SUs) have particular features compared to the PUs; sensing is one of the principal. Specifically the CR users must detect the spectrum holes left by PUs by performing sensing. All the protocol stack need to be redesigned taking into account the specificity of the cognitive environment. In this paper a novel MAC protocol for cognitive radio wireless ad-hoc networks is presented and analysed. The introduced protocol is distributed, collision-free and guarantees a fair channel assignment, also taking into account the requests of Quality of Service (QoS) of the CR nodes. The performance of the protocol has been studied through statistical computations. In particular, a Markov chain has been introduced to study the global performance of the protocol. In addition a simulation tool has been developed to validate the mathematical model and to prove the fairness of the resource sharing mechanism. The results prove the protocol efficiency and the high fairness, measured with the help of the Jain's fairness index.",

    "abstract": "Cognitive science may be loosely described as the activity of trying to model aspects of human behaviour upon a computer. It has emerged as a blending of the techniques of artificial intelligence and cognitive psychology but these two disciplines have different, and incompatible, philosophies. Searle has detected elements of behaviourism and operationism within artificial intelligence, whereas cognitive psychology is essentially anti-behaviourist. It is argued that cognitive science needs to distinguish between \u2018competence\u2019 and \u2018performance\u2019 in order to clarify this point, and that such a distinction has far-reaching effects on how we view computer simulations of behaviour.",

This paper presents an analysis of SPI across six software teams in the UK using a framework based on Giddens\u2019 Structuration Theory. Using a structurational perspective helps to draw out how the process improvements are enabled and constrained by their context. By comparing these across the six situations the key similarities and differences across the cases are highlighted.

    "abstract": "The problem of joint feature selection across a group of related tasks has applications in many areas including biomedical informatics and computer vision. We consider the l2, 1-norm regularized regression model for joint feature selection from multiple tasks, which can be derived in the probabilistic framework by assuming a suitable prior from the exponential family. One appealing feature of the l2, 1-norm regularization is that it encourages multiple predictors to share similar sparsity patterns. However, the resulting optimization problem is challenging to solve due to the non-smoothness of the l2, 1-norm regularization. In this paper, we propose to accelerate the computation by reformulating it as two equivalent smooth convex optimization problems which are then solved via the Nesterov's method---an optimal first-order black-box method for smooth convex optimization. A key building block in solving the reformulations is the Euclidean projection. We show that the Euclidean projection for the first reformulation can be analytically computed, while the Euclidean projection for the second one can be computed in linear time. Empirical evaluations on several data sets verify the efficiency of the proposed algorithms.",

All methods known until now for conducting such search in parallel fail to provide consistent linear speedups over sequential execution. The speedups vary between sublinear to superlinear and from run to run. Further, adding processors may sometimes lead to a slow-down rather than speedup, giving rise to speedup anomalies. We present prioritizing strategies which yield consistent linear speedups and requires substantially smaller memory over other methods.

In this paper, we describe an analytical performance model that measures the important performance indicators, namely, rejection probability and total delay, of a cloud center whilst taking into account live migration of virtual machines.

    "abstract": "In many practical distributed source coding (DSC) applications, correlation information has to be estimated at the encoder in order to determine the encoding rate. Coding efficiency depends strongly on the accuracy of this correlation estimation. While error in estimation is inevitable, the impact of estimation error on compression efficiency has not been sufficiently studied for the DSC problem. In this paper, we study correlation estimation subject to rate and complexity constraints, and its impact on coding efficiency in a DSC framework for practical distributed image and video applications. We focus on, in particular, applications where binary correlation models are exploited for Slepian-Wolf coding and sampling techniques are used to estimate the correlation, while extensions to other correlation models would also be briefly discussed. In the first part of this paper, we investigate the compression of binary data. We first propose a model to characterize the relationship between the number of samples used in estimation and the coding rate penalty, in the case of encoding of a single binary source. The model is then extended to scenarios where multiple binary sources are compressed, and based on the model we propose an algorithm to determine the number of samples allocated to different sources so that the overall rate penalty can be minimized, subject to a constraint on the total number of samples. The second part of this paper studies compression of continuous-valued data. We propose a model-based estimation for the particular but important situations where binary bit-planes are extracted from a continuous-valued input source, and each bit-plane is compressed using DSC. The proposed model-based method first estimates the source and correlation noise models using continuous-valued samples, and then uses the models to derive the bit-plane statistics analytically. We also extend the model-based estimation to the cases when bit-planes are extracted based on the significance of the data, similar to those commonly used in wavelet-based applications. Experimental results, including some based on hyperspectral image compression, demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed algorithms.",

    "abstract": "Background: Parameter estimation in biological models is a common yet challenging problem. In this work we explore the problem for gene regulatory networks modeled by differential equations with unknown parameters, such as decay rates, reaction rates, Michaelis-Menten constants, and Hill coefficients. We explore the question to what extent parameters can be efficiently estimated by appropriate experimental selection. Results: A minimization formulation is used to find the parameter values that best fit the experiment data. When the data is insufficient, the minimization problem often has many local minima that fit the data reasonably well. We show that selecting a new experiment based on the local Fisher Information of one local minimum generates additional data that allows one to successfully discriminate among the many local minima. The parameters can be estimated to high accuracy by iteratively performing minimization and experiment selection. We show that the experiment choices are roughly independent of which local minima is used to calculate the local Fisher Information. Conclusions: We show that by an appropriate choice of experiments, one can, in principle, efficiently and accurately estimate all the parameters of gene regulatory network. In addition, we demonstrate that appropriate experiment selection can also allow one to restrict model predictions without constraining the parameters using many fewer experiments. We suggest that predicting model behaviors and inferring parameters represent two different approaches to model calibration with different requirements on data and experimental cost.",

    "abstract": "SeDAX is a publish/subscribe information-centric networking architecture where publishers send messages to the appropriate message broker over a Delaunay-triangulated overlay network. Resilient data forwarding and data redundancy enable a high level of reliability. Overlay nodes and topics are addressed via geo-coordinates. A topic is stored on primary and secondary nodes, those nodes closest and second-closest to the topic's coordinate, respectively. The overlay automatically reroutes a topic's messages to its secondary node should its primary node fail. Currently, SeDAX determines the coordinate of a topic by hashing its name. This kind of topic allocation is static, which can lead to unintended load imbalances. In this paper, we propose a topic delegation mechanism to make the assignment of topics to nodes dynamic. Our proposed mechanism is the only existing method to improve the flexibility and resource management of the SeDAX architecture so far. We define the load of SeDAX nodes and coordinates at different levels of resilience. On this basis, we develop distributed algorithms for load balancing. Simulations show that significant load imbalance can occur with static topic assignment and that the proposed algorithms achieve very good load balancing results.",

    "abstract": "This paper deals with the problem of calibrating a large number of tactile elements (i.e., taxels) organized in a skin sensor system after fixing them to a robot body part. This problem has not received much attention in literature because of the lack of large-scale skin sensor systems. The proposed approach is based on a controlled compliance motion with respect to external objects whose pose is known, which allows a robot to determine the location of its own taxels. The major contribution of this work is the formulation of the skin calibration problem as a maximum-likelihood mapping problem in a 6D space, where both the position and the orientation of each taxel are recovered. An effective calibration process is envisaged that, given a compliance control law that assures prolonged contact maintainance between a given body part and an external object, returns a maximum-likelihood estimate of detected taxel poses. Simulations validate the approach.",

    "abstract": "This paper concerns the possibility of developing a coherent theory of security when feasibility is associated with expected probabilistic polynomial-time (expected PPT). The source of difficulty is that the known definitions of expected PPT strategies (i.e., expected PPT interactive machines) do not support natural results of the type presented below. To overcome this difficulty, we suggest new definitions of expected PPT strategies, which are more restrictive than the known definitions (but nevertheless extend the notion of expected PPT non-interactive algorithms). We advocate the conceptual adequacy of these definitions, and point out their technical advantages. Specifically, identifying a natural subclass of black-box simulators, called normal, we prove the following two results: 1. Security proofs that refer to all strict PPT adversaries (and are proven via normal black-box simulators) extend to provide security with respect to all adversaries that satisfy the restricted definitions of expected PPT. 2. Security composition theorems of the type known for strict PPT hold for these restricted definitions of expected PPT, where security means simulation by normal black-box simulators.#R##N##R##N#Specifically, a normal black-box simulator is required to make an expected polynomial number of steps, when given oracle access to any strategy, where each oracle call is counted as a single step. This natural property is satisfies by most known simulators and is easy to verify.",

    "abstract": "This paper proposes a strategy for handling a single object by cooperation of multiple robots controlled by PID position controllers. Since such a cooperative system has mechanical closed loops, installation of free joints or flexibility among robots is necessary to avoid excessive inner forces caused by the positioning error of each robot. First, the essential kinematic conditions to achieve the cooperation among position-controlled robots are shown. Second, the relationship between the positioning error of the handling object and that of each robot is analyzed. Finally, a mechanism for the cooperation of three mobile robots is proposed and its kinematic characteristics and statics are analyzed. The strategy proposed here is very effective and practical for cooperation of not only conventional industrial robots but also distributed autonomous mobile robot systems with non-holonomic constraints. >",

We develop a scheduling algorithm that reacts to time varying channels and maximizes throughput utility (to within a desired proximity), stabilizes all queues, and satisfies the delay constraints. The problem is solved by reducing the constrained optimization to a set of weighted stochastic shortest path problems, which act as natural generalizations of max-weight policies to Markov decision networks. We also present approximation results for the corresponding shortest path problems, and discuss the additional complexity and delay incurred as compared to systems without delay constraints. The solution technique is general and applies to other constrained stochastic decision problems.",

First, we divide the jamming scene template into sub-templates according to the depth of focus in the range dimension. Next, each sub-template is decomposed into the slow-time-dependent and slow-time-independent terms in the range frequency-azimuth time domain. The slow-time-independent terms are generated off-line while the slow-time-dependent terms are generated by real-time 1-D frequency modulation. Then, the sub-templates are convolved with the intercepted SAR signals simultaneously. Finally, fast deceptive jamming is achieved by incorporating all the sub-templates together. In the proposed method, the two-step realization of the sub-templates and the parallel sub-block processing improves the algorithm efficiency. The simulation results prove the validity of the proposed algorithm.",

Similarity between web pages is a concept that is central to such tools. In this paper, we examine the effect that content and layout-related aspects of web pages have on web page similarity. We consider the textual content contained within common HTML tags, the structural layout of pages, and the query terms contained within pages. Our study shows that combinations of factors can yield more promising results than individual factors, and that different aspects of web pages affect similarities between pages in a different manner. We found a number of factors that, when taken into account, can result in effective measures of similarity between web pages.

Location management plays an important role in location-aware computing because the provision of services requires convenient access to dynamic location and location-dependent information. Many existing location management strategies are passive since they rely on system capability to periodically record current location information. In contrast, active strategies predict user movement through trajectories and locations. Trajectory prediction provides richer location and context information and facilitates the means for adapting to future locations.

    "abstract": "Automated Window / Icon / Menu / Pointing Device User Interface (WIMP-UI) generation has been considered a promising technology for at least two decades. One of the major reasons why it has not become mainstream so far is that the usability of automatically generated UIs is rather low. This is mainly because non-functional requirements like layout or style issues are not considered adequately during the generation process. This paper proposes an automated layout approach that supports the explicit specification of layout parameters in device-independent and thus reusable transformation rules. Missing layout parameters are completed automatically, based on 'Layout Hints' under the consideration of scrolling preferences. We are aware that human intervention in the context of UI development will always be required to create high-quality UIs. Therefore, we aim to improve the generated UI by considering hints and applying heuristics, rather than solving a problem for which we believe that there is no generic solution.",

    "abstract": "Information systems' modelling is based on separation of concern such as separation into facets or viewpoints on the application domain from one side and separation of aspects (structuring, functionality, interactivity, distribution, architectural components) from the other side. Facets and aspects are typically specified through different models that must be harmonised and made coherent. Such varieties of models are difficult to handle, to evolve, to maintain and to use. Most design methodologies adopt the master-slave principle in or- der to handle the coherence of such model assemblies by assigning one model to be the master and mapping the master to slave models. Moreover, these mod- els diagrams are typically not developed from scratch. They are incrementally completed step by step depending on the modelling methodology. Models evolve during development and are not independent, are interrelated, and in most appli- cations also intertwined. Their interrelationships are often not made explicit and impose changes resulting in inconsistencies to other models due to the variety of models. Therefore, this paper introduces the theory of model suites as a set of models with explicit associations among the models. Model suites are based on explicit controllers for maintenance of coherence, apply application schemata for their explicit maintenance and evolution, use tracers for establishment of their coher- ence and thus support co-evolution of information system models. The excitabil- ity is captured by integrating model suites and MetaCASE formalisms, exploring the (modelling) method engineering and tool generation required for multi-model development.",

The Fat-Btree has a threefold aim: to provide an indexing mechanism for fast retrieval in each processor; to balance the amount of data among distributed disks, and to reduce synchronization costs between processors during update operations. We use a probability based model to compare the throughput and response time of the Fat-Btree with two ordinary parallel Btree structures, with copies of a whole Btree in each processor and storing index nodes in a processor. The comparison results indicate that the Fat-Btree is suitable for actual parallel database systems that accept update operations.",

    "abstract": "Multiproduct pipelines transport fuels from refineries to distant distribution terminals in batches. The energy needed to move the fluids through the pipeline is mainly associated with elevation gradients and friction head loss. Commonly, friction loss is the major term requiring pump stations to keep the flow moving, and it is strongly dependent on the fluid flow rate. Some studies have been carried out for reducing the pumping costs in multiproduct pipelines, but none of them has been focused on thoroughly considering the head loss due to friction along the pipeline. This paper introduces a novel MINLP continuous-time formulation for the detailed scheduling of single-source pipelines, rigorously tracking power consumption at every pipeline segment through nonlinear equations. Real-world case studies are successfully solved using GAMS\u2013DICOPT algorithm, which proves to be a useful tool for solving large-scale, nonlinear scheduling problems. Important reductions in the operation costs are achieved by keeping a more stable flow rate profile over the planning horizon.",

This challenge is getting even bigger when visualization refers to devices with limited capabilities, like CPU and GPU power, number of RAM or screen size. In this paper we present a distributed system we have developed for interactive visualization of remote datasets on variety of modern mobile devices, including laptops, tablets and phones. In our system all the data are rendered on dedicated servers, compressed on-the-fly using a video codec and pushed to client as a single video stream. Based on this model we have taken off most of the computational power from client's devices, leaving them with a video decompression. We were also able to achieve very high frame rates and video quality, dynamically adapted to device capabilities and current network bandwidth of a client. Our system can be used with almost any kind of data, including 2D, 3D and even animated 3D data. All of them are being processed in real time based on user inputs, with minor latency, allowing interactive visualization. At the end of this paper we also present some preliminary results of system performance gained using sample, multidimensional medical datasets.",

    "abstract": "Electromigration (EM) in the on-die metal lines has re-emerged as a significant concern in modern VLSI circuits. The higher levels of temperature on die and the very large number of metal lines, coupled with the conservatism inherent in traditional EM checking strategies, have led to a situation where trying to guarantee EM reliability often leads to unacceptably conservative designs that may not meet the area or performance specs. Due to unidirectional currents, this problem is most significant in the power and ground grids. Thus, this work is aimed at reducing the pessimism in EM prediction for power/ground grids. There are two sources for the high pessimism: 1) the use of the traditional series model for EM checking and 2) pessimistic assumptions about the chip workload and the corresponding supply currents. To address this problem, we propose a framework for EM checking that allows users to specify conditions-of-use type constraints that help capture realistic chip workload and which includes the use of a novel mesh model for EM prediction in the grid, instead of the traditional series model.",

The solution was evaluated as a case study in a real-world e-System designed to automatically collect report data.",

    "abstract": "Large events like the Super Bowl, where almost 75K attendees congegrate for several hours, poses a significant challenge in the planning, design and deployment of wireless networks. This was one of the first events where the LTE cellular network was available widely, in addition to almost 700 WiFi free hotspots. The Super Bowl in 2013 was also unprecedented because of a stadium-wide power outage for over half an hour. This study is the first to look in-depth at the user behaviours and traffic demand of a large ISP's celluar network at such an unique event.   The findings of this study can be used to guide the design of the communication networks of large venues in the future. There are several key insights from our study of the data collected. First, LTE speeds enable subscribers at venues to stream high-quality video and this can be a signficant source of traffic. Second, the configuration of the uplink for such events is key, and a thoughtful approach to the design of applications that use the cloud for storing user data can substantially mitigate the congestion on the resource constrained uplink. Further, while it is tempting to take advantage of multicast on the cellular network (e.g., deploying technologies such as eMBMS in a venue), our results indicate that there is a need to combine multicast with caching to remove the strict requirement of overlap of requests from users to derive that benefit.",

    "abstract": "Browsing ontologies and making sense of their concepts and relationships are important activities in knowledge engineering. They are supported by a large number of tools that often provide visual representations of the ontologies for better illustration. However, different notations are used to represent the ontologies which can be confusing when switching tools. Furthermore, many representations provide only basic overviews of the ontologies that are not sufficient to get a deeper understanding of the concepts and relationships. A unified visual notation for OWL ontologies would be most helpful to overcome these limitations. Having this goal in mind, we compare two different notations for OWL ontologies in this paper: the UML profile of the Ontology Definition Metamodel (ODM) and the Visual Notation for OWL Ontologies (VOWL). We report on a comparative user study of these notations and discuss benefits and limitations raised by the study participants. Based on these findings, we draw some general conclusions regarding the development of a unified visual notation for OWL ontologies.",

    "abstract": "The generative summarization of textual stories has been one of the goals of computational narratology since attempts at full semantic NLU in the '70s. Our NLP group has recently created several systems for multidocument news summarization, but using purely statistical methods. Between these poles, there may be an unexplored avenue where knowledge of story structure can give partial, yet useful semantic understanding to a news reader. Such knowledge can then lead to summaries more informed than those based on solely statistical means. This student paper represents work in progress on a two-module system: The first module categorizes news articles into their underlying dramatic structures; the second will attempt to use this understanding to create and execute a generative plan, concisely retelling the story to form a surface-level summary.",

    "abstract": "This paper proposes a joint verification-localization structure based on split-band analysis of speech signal and the mixed voicing level. To address the problems in reverberant acoustic environments, a new fundamental frequency estimation algorithm is proposed based on high resolution spectral estimation. In the reconstruction of the distorted speech this information is utilized to reduce the side effect of acoustic noise on the voicing parts. A speaker verification system examines the features of the reconstructed speech in order to authorize the speaker before localization. This procedure prevents localization and beamforming for non-speech and specially the unwanted speakers in multi-speaker scenarios. The verification is implemented with the Gaussian Mixture Model and a new filtering scheme is proposed based on the voicing likelihood of each frequency band measured in the previous steps for efficient localization of the authorized speaker. The performance of the proposed VSL (verified speaker localization) front-end is evaluated in various reverberant and noisy environments. The VSL is utilized in the development of distant-talking automatic speech recognition by microphone array where the system can lock on a specific source and hence the recognition quality improves noticeably.",

    "abstract": "The challenge in developing agents for incomplete information games resides in the fact that the maximum utility decision for given informa- tion set is not always ascertainable. For large games like Poker, the agents' strategies require opponent modeling, since Nash equilibrium strategies are hard to compute. In light of this, simulation systems are indispensable for accu- rate assessment of agents' capabilities. Nevertheless, current systems do not ac- commodate the needs of computer poker research since they were designed mainly as an interface for human players competing against agents. In order to contribute towards improving computer poker research, a new simulation sys- tem was developed. This system introduces scientifically unexplored game modes with the purpose of providing a more realistic simulation environment, where the agent must play carefully to manage its initial resources. An evolu- tionary simulation feature was also included so as to provide support for the improvement of adaptive strategies. The simulator has built-in odds calculation, an agent development API, other platform agents and several variants support and an agent classifier with realistic game indicators including exploitability es- timation. Tests and qualitative analysis have proven this simulator to be faster and better suited for thorough agent development and performance assessment.",

They are served on first-come-first-served basis following a cost-optimal routing policy. The customer at the head of a queue generates a Poisson stream of repeated requests for service, that is, we have a constant retrial policy. All service times are exponential, with rates depending on the queues. The costs to be minimized consist of costs per unit time that a customer spends in the system. In case of a scheduling problem that arise when no new customers arrive an explicit condition for server allocation to the first or the second queue is given. The condition presented covers all possible parameter choices. For scheduling that also considers new arrivals, we present the conditions under which server assignment to either queue 1 or queue 2 is cost-optimal.",

Discriminative key poses are represented by the atoms of the action-specific dictionaries. With the specific dictionaries, sparse codes are obtained for representing action instances through max pooling and temporal pyramid. A SVM classifier is trained for action recognition.

    "abstract": "In this paper we propose a new approach to theorem proving in first-order logic based on the term-rewriting method. First for propositional calculus, we introduce a canonical term-rewriting system for Boolean algebra. This system enables us to transform the first-order predicate calculus into a form of equational logic, and to develop several complete strategies (both clausal and nonclausal) for first-order theories based on the Knuth-Bendix Completion Procedure. More importantly, our strategies can deal with predicate logic and built-in (equational) theories in a uniform and effecave way. We also describe an implementation and comparisons with some other first-order theoremproving methods. 0. Structure of the Paper This paper has five sections. The first section gives a brief account of the basic notions of the term-rewriting method. In Section 2, we present a canonical term-rewriting system for Boolean algebra. This system is used as a basis for developing several complete theorem-proving strategies for the first-order predicate calculus in Section 3. In Section 4, the strategies given in Section 3 are extended to deal with richer theories--first- order logic with built-in equational axioms. An implementation of these methods is described in Section 5, together with some experimental results and discussions.",

    "abstract": "Identification of possible protein targets of small chemical molecules is an important step for unravelling their underlying causes of actions at the molecular level. To this end, we construct a web server, idTarget, which can predict possible binding targets of a small chemical molecule via a divide-and-conquer docking approach, in combination with our recently developed scoring functions based on robust regression analysis and quantum chemical charge models. Affinity profiles of the protein targets are used to provide the confidence levels of prediction. The divide-and-conquer docking approach uses adaptively constructed small overlapping grids to constrain the searching space, thereby achieving better docking efficiency. Unlike previous approaches that screen against a specific class of targets or a limited number of targets, idTarget screen against nearly all protein structures deposited in the Protein Data Bank (PDB). We show that idTarget is able to reproduce known off-targets of drugs or drug-like compounds, and the suggested new targets could be prioritized for further investigation. idTarget is freely available as a web-based server at http://idtarget.rcas.sinica.edu.tw.",

    "abstract": "In this study, a multistage neural network ensemble learning model is proposed to evaluate credit risk at the measurement level. The proposed model consists of six stages. In the first stage, a bagging sampling approach is used to generate different training data subsets especially for data shortage. In the second stage, the different neural network models are created with different training subsets obtained from the previous stage. In the third stage, the generated neural network models are trained with different training datasets and accordingly the classification score and reliability value of neural classifier can be obtained. In the fourth stage, a decorrelation maximization algorithm is used to select the appropriate ensemble members. In the fifth stage, the reliability values of the selected neural network models (i.e., ensemble members) are scaled into a unit interval by logistic transformation. In the final stage, the selected neural network ensemble members are fused to obtain final classification result by means of reliability measurement. For illustration, two publicly available credit datasets are used to verify the effectiveness of the proposed multistage neural network ensemble model.",

    "abstract": "The problem of privacy-preserving data mining has been studied extensively in recent years because of its importance as a key enabler in the sharing of massive data sets. Most of the work in privacy has focussed on issues involving the quality of privacy preservation and utility, though there has been little focus on the issue of scalability in privacy preservation. The reason for this is that anonymization has generally been seen as a batch and one-time process in the context of data sharing. However, in recent years, the sizes of data sets have grown tremendously to a point where the effective application of the current algorithms is becoming increasingly difficult. Furthermore, the transient nature of recent data sets has resulted in an increased need for the repeated application of such methods on the newer data sets which have been collected. Repeated application demands even greater computational efficiency in order to be practical. For example, an algorithm with quadratic complexity is unlikely to be implementable in reasonable time over terabyte scale data sets. A bigger issue is that larger data sets are likely to be addressed by distributed frameworks such as  MapReduce . In such frameworks, one has to address the additional issue of minimizing data transfer across different nodes, which is the bottleneck. In this paper, we discuss the first approach towards privacy-preserving data mining of very massive data sets using  MapReduce . We study two most widely-used privacy models k-anonymity and  l -diversity for anonymization, and present experimental results illustrating the effectiveness of the approach.",

    "abstract": "This paper addresses perspectives of creative teaching and learning strategies in the new learning context of mobile technology, particularly for novice learners. The discussion presented here is framed by two case studies and uses an ethnographical approach, informed by participant observation to consider the experiences of users of mobile devices who do not have prior experience with information and communication technologies. Although the lack of prior understanding of the novice user initially presented a hurdle for working with mobile technology tools, it was noted that an 'innocence of perceiving and behaving' Maslow, 1971 could advantage these learners to work in new and creative ways that may not be considered by more experienced users. It was also identified that the creative learning could be facilitated by intentional support and both innovative teaching strategies and imaginative teaching scenarios are important components of this framework.",

The systems we consider are dynamic in two senses: (1) components can be created and destroyed as computation proceeds, and (2) the events in which the components may participate may change. The new model admits a notion of external system behavior, based on sets of traces. It also features a parallel composition operator for dynamic systems, which respects external behavior, and a notion of simulation from one dynamic system to another, which can be used to prove that one system implements the other.#R##N##R##N#The DIOA model was defined to support the analysis of mobile agent systems, in a joint project with researchers at Nippon Telephone and Telegraph.

We capture the pedestrian candidate areas with a window of fixed size, conduct feature extraction to candidate areas and mobile images with Haar-like rectangle feature calculation and then, complete pedestrian by using the proposed cascade-Adaboost-SVM classifier. As this cascade-Adaboost-SVM classifier can adjust numbers of cascade classifiers adaptively, it can construct cascade classifiers effectively based on training set. Finally, we complete the pedestrian detection experiment with the database of captured samples and PETs database.

    "abstract": "Traditional routing protocols deployed to provide communication among mobile nodes in wireless ad hoc networks (MANET) assume a trust and collaborating environment inside the network. However, this assumption is not always true and a hostile or unprotected environment can seriously affect the protocol and network performance. In this work two kinds of approaches are applied to a well-known routing protocol called SAODV in order to improve its performance and to offer more resilience to attack from malicious nodes authenticated by the network. A preventive approach based on a cryptographic mechanism and a reactive approach to detect the anomalous and malicious behavior of nodes are considered. An extension of SAODV to offer Intrusion Detection mechanism (IDM) and trust-based mechanism (TBM) to promote the collaboration of the cooperating node and penalize the selfish nodes are proposed. The extended and proposed protocol SAODV-SDO is presented and simulation results were performed in order to show the effectiveness of our proposal in comparison with AODV and SAODV.",

However, these diagnostic systems are not reliable when the working conditions are different from those expected at design time. In this paper, we present OMISSYS (Opportunistic Model-based diagnosIS SYStem), a system that can diagnose faults in plants whose components are imperfectly described, and where data are affected by uncertainty and imprecision. OMISSYS exploits the available knowledge and data to obtain a suboptimal diagnosis for the detected fault.  We represent imperfection using uncertain-fuzzy numbers, a formalism that can represent both uncertainty and imprecision.  OMISSYS was tested on realistic examples and it efficiently produced satisfactory diagnoses.",

    "abstract": "Clickstream data collected at any web site (site-centric data) is inherently incomplete, since it does not capture users' browsing behavior across sites (user-centric data). Hence, models learned from such data may be subject to limitations, the nature of which has not been well studied. Understanding the limitations is particularly important since most current personalization techniques are based on site-centric data only. In this paper, we empirically examine the implications of learning from incomplete data in the context of two specific problems: (a) predicting if the remainder of any given session will result in a purchase and (b) predicting if a given user will make a purchase at any future session. For each of these problems we present new algorithms for fast and accurate data preprocessing of clickstream data. Based on a comprehensive experiment on user-level clickstream data gathered from 20,000 users' browsing behavior, we demonstrate that models built on user-centric data outperform models built on site-centric data for both prediction tasks.",

The optimization approach is not suitable for many problems arising in modern manufacturing systems due to their complexity and involvement of qualitative factors. Expert systems appear to remedy the latter weakness of optimization approaches. The biggest disadvantage of expert systems in manufacturing environment is the slow response time. In this paper an integrand approach involving knowledge-based and optimization approaches is explored. The knowledge-and optimization-based approach is applied to solve two manufacturing problems: group technology (static problem) and scheduling (dynamic problem). The approach presented is illustrated with numerical example and computational results.",

Privacy policies are supposed to inform users how their personal information is handled by a website. However, several studies have shown that users rarely read privacy policies for various reasons, not least because limitedly readable policy texts are difficult to understand. Based on our online survey with over 440 responses, we examine the objective and subjective readability of privacy policies and investigate their impact on users\u2019 trust in five big Internet services. Our findings show the stronger a user believes in having understood the privacy policy, the higher he or she trusts a web site across all companies we studied.

    "abstract": "Topological analysis of intelligent agent networks provides crucial information about the structure of agent distribution over a network. Performance analysis of agent network topologies helps multi-agent system developers to understand the impact of topology on system efficiency and effectiveness. Appropriate topology analysis enables the adoption of suitable frameworks for specific multi-agent systems. In this paper, we systematically classify agent network topologies and propose a novel hybrid topology for distributed multi-agent systems. We compare the performance of this topology with two other common agent network topologies-centralised and decentralised topologies-within a new multi-agent framework, called Agent-based Open Connectivity for DSS (AOCD). Three major aspects are studied for estimating topology performance, which include (i) transmission time for a set of requests; (ii) waiting time for processing requests; and (iii) memory consumption for storing agent information. We also conduct a set of AOCD topological experiments to compare the performance of hybrid and centralised agent network topologies and illustrate our experimental results in this paper.",

    "abstract": "In this paper, a new unsupervised design method of the weighted median filter (WMF) is proposed for recovering images from impulse noise. A design problem of WMFs is to determine a suitable window shape, and an appropriate weight for each element in the window. The purpose of the filter for the noise removal is generally to estimate the original values precisely for corrupted pixels while preserving the original values of non-corrupted pixels. WMF is required to output the image with higher preservation quality and higher restoration quality, however, these qualities often have a trade-off relation. Here, we formulate the design of WMF as a multi-objective optimization problem that treats the preservation performance and the restoration performance as trade-off functions. Through the experiments, we show our method obtains a wide variety of filters that have the high preservation performance or the high restoration performance at one search process. In addition, we also discuss how to select a good set of sophisticated filters from the designed filters.",

Many different model transformation languages have been proposed with a significant tool development cost as common language elements like expressions, statements, ... must be built from scratch for each new language development tools. The Tom language is a shallow extension of Java tailored to describe and implement transformations of tree based data-structures. A key feature of Tom allows to map any Java data-structure to tree based data abstractions that can then be accessed by powerful non-linear, associative, commutative pattern matching. In this paper, we present how this approach can be used in order to develop model transformations, in particular relying on Eclipse Modeling Framework (EMF) based metamodeling facilities.

    "abstract": "Advanced 3D mobile devices attract a lot of attentions for 3D visualization nowadays. Stereoscopic images and video taken from the 3D mobile devices are uncomfortable for 3D viewing experiences due to the limited hardware for stereoscopic 3D stabilization. The existing stereoscopic 3D stabilization methods are computationally inefficient for the 3D mobile devices. In this article, we point out that this critical issue deteriorates the 3D viewing experiences on the 3D mobile devices. To improve visual comfort, we propose an efficient and effective algorithm to stabilize the stereoscopic images and video for the 3D mobile devices. To rectify the video jitter, we use the gyroscope and accelerometer embedded on the mobile devices to obtain the geometry information of the cameras. Using a different method than video-content-based motion estimation, our algorithm based on the gyroscope and acceleration data can achieve higher accuracy to effectively stabilize the video. Therefore, our approach is robust in video stabilization even under poor lighting and substantial foreground motion. Our algorithm outperforms previous approaches in not only smaller running time but also the better comfort of the stereoscopic 3D visualization for the 3D mobile devices.",

    "abstract": "An efficient method for color edge detection using a uniform color space and Euclidean distance between the color vectors is proposed. Two color vectors are perceptually distinguishable if Euclidean distance between them is greater than Just Noticeable Color Distance (JNCD) threshold. In the presence of noise, the threshold tends to be greater than JNCD and is adaptively determined from the statistical analysis of an image scan line. The edges are detected by determining and thresholding local extremities in each image scan line. The proposed operator is quantitatively evaluated on a set of test images using Pratt's figure of merit. As opposed to other color edge detectors, the proposed method is time efficient. It takes only 1 second to compute edge map of a 400\u00d7400 color image, which makes it suitable for real time problems like obstacle detection, color cheque processing, etc.",

    "abstract": "This paper proposes a temporal neuro-fuzzy system named ANFIS_unfolded_in_time which is designed to provide an environment that keeps temporal relationships between the variables and to forecast the future behavior of data by using fuzzy rules. It is a modification of ANFIS neuro-fuzzy model. The rule base of ANFIS_unfolded_in_time contains temporal TSK(Takagi-Sugeno-Kang) fuzzy rules. In the training phase, back-propagation learning algorithm is used. The system takes the multivariate data and the number of lags needed to construct the unfolded model in order to describe a variable and predicts the future behavior. Computer simulations are performed by using real multivariate data and a benchmark problem (Gas Furnace Data). Experimental results show that the proposed model achieves online learning and prediction on temporal data. The results are compared with the results of ANFIS.",

    "abstract": "Embedded within large-scale protein interaction networks are signaling pathways that encode response cascades in the cell. Unfortunately, even for well-studied species like S. cerevisiae, only a fraction of all true protein interactions are known, which makes it difficult to reason about the exact flow of signals and the corresponding causal relations in the network. To help address this problem, we introduce a framework for predicting new interactions that aid connectivity between upstream proteins (sources) and downstream transcription factors (targets) of a particular pathway. Our algorithms attempt to globally minimize the distance between sources and targets by finding a small set of shortcut edges to add to the network. Unlike existing algorithms for predicting general protein interactions, by focusing on proteins involved in specific responses our approach homes-in on pathway-consistent interactions. We applied our method to extend pathways in osmotic stress response in yeast and identified several missing interactions, some of which are supported by published reports. We also performed experiments that support a novel interaction not previously reported. Our framework is general and may be applicable to edge prediction problems in other domains.",

    "abstract": "Cortical networks, in-vitro as well as in-vivo, can spontaneously generate a variety of collective dynamical events such as network spikes, UP and DOWN states, global oscillations, and avalanches. Though each of them has been variously recognized in previous works as expression of the excitability of the cortical tissue and the associated nonlinear dynamics, a unified picture of the determinant factors (dynamical and architectural) is desirable and not yet available. Progress has also been partially hindered by the use of a variety of statistical measures to define the network events of interest. We propose here a common probabilistic definition of network events that, applied to the firing activity of cultured neural networks, highlights the co-occurrence of network spikes, power-law distributed avalanches, and exponentially distributed \u2018quasi-orbits\u2019, which offer a third type of collective behavior. A rate model, including synaptic excitation and inhibition with no imposed topology, synaptic short-term depression, and finite-size noise, accounts for all these different, coexisting phenomena. We find that their emergence is largely regulated by the proximity to an oscillatory instability of the dynamics, where the non-linear excitable behavior leads to a self-amplification of activity fluctuations over a wide range of scales in space and time. In this sense, the cultured network dynamics is compatible with an excitation-inhibition balance corresponding to a slightly sub-critical regime. Finally, we propose and test a method to infer the characteristic time of the fatigue process, from the observed time course of the network\u2019s firing rate. Unlike the model, possessing a single fatigue mechanism, the cultured network appears to show multiple time scales, signalling the possible coexistence of different fatigue mechanisms.",

From a broad perspective, this study provides a better understanding of innovation activity mediated by social media--particularly the government's Twitter activity, a topic that has not been addressed by previous webometric research on Triple Helix relationships--by employing social network analysis and content analysis. The results indicate some limitations of the MFAFF's activity on Twitter as a mutual communication channel, although Twitter has the potential to facilitate risk management. Further, based on the MFAFF's confined use of its Twitter account, the results suggest that its Twitter account can be an effective information distribution channel, indicating Twitter's value as a communication tool for innovation activity through social media. This study provides an empirical analysis of the government's Twitter activity and contributes to the literature by providing an in-depth understanding of the Triple Helix relationship on the Web.",

    "abstract": "We have developed a method for automated probabilistic reconstruction of a set of major white-matter pathways from diffusion-weighted MR images. Our method is called TRACULA (TRActs Constrained by UnderLying Anatomy) and utilizes prior information on the anatomy of the pathways from a set of training subjects. By incorporating this prior knowledge in the reconstruction procedure, our method obviates the need for manual interaction with the tract solutions at a later stage and thus facilitates the application of tractography to large studies. In this paper we illustrate the application of the method on data from a schizophrenia study and investigate whether the inclusion of both patients and healthy subjects in the training set affects our ability to reconstruct the pathways reliably. We show that, since our method does not constrain the exact spatial location or shape of the pathways but only their trajectory relative to the surrounding anatomical structures, a set a of healthy training subjects can be used to reconstruct the pathways accurately in patients as well as in controls.",

Such asymptotic expansions have already been used to design direct (i.e. noniterative) reconstruction algorithms for the determination of the location of the small inclusions from electrostatic measurements on the boundary, e.g. MUSIC-type methods.

It is very important to study the kinesthetic perception of the human and to optimize the teleoperation system accordingly. To cancel out the influence of human's hand vibration the signal from the masterarm should be filtered.

IPG's Environmental Strategy Team is leading an initiative to establish these metrics internally. This paper describes the development process the authors followed to construct the initial metrics, which are focused on the \"carbon footprint\" of products under development. The paper also discusses the lessons learned developing the initial metrics, the results achieved thus far, implementation details, challenges, and future opportunities for improvement.",

    "abstract": "Organ segmentation is a challenging problem on which significant progress has been made. Deformable models (DM) and graphical models (GM) are two important categories of optimization based image segmentation methods. Efforts have been made on integrating two types of models into one framework. However, previous methods are not designed for segmenting multiple organs simultaneously and accurately. In this paper, we propose a hybrid multi organ segmentation approach by integrating DM and GM in a coupled optimization framework. Specifically, we show that region-based deformable models can be integrated with Markov Random Fields (MRF), such that multiple models' evo- lutions are driven by a maximum a posteriori (MAP) inference. It brings global and local deformation constraints into a unified framework for simultaneous seg- mentation of multiple objects in an image. We validate this proposed method on two challenging problems of multi organ segmentation, and the results are promising.",

    "abstract": "In virtualized datacenters, accurately measuring the power consumption of virtual machines (VMs) is the prerequisite to achieve the goal of fine-grained power management. However, existing VM power models can only provide power measurements with empirical accuracy and unbounded error. In this paper, we firstly formulize the co-relation between utilization and accuracy of power model, and compare two classes of VM power models; then we propose a novel VM power model which is based on a conception named relative performance monitoring counter (PMC); finally, based on the relative PMC power model, we propose a novel VM scheduling algorithm which uses the information of relative PMC to compensate the recursive power consumption. Theoretical analysis indicates that the proposed algorithm can provide bounded error when measuring per-VM power consumption. Extensive experiments are conducted by using various benchmarks on different platforms, and the results show that the error of per-VM power measurement can be significantly reduced. In addition, the proposed algorithm is effective to improve the power efficiency of a server when its virtualization ratio is high.",

To date, implementations have required significant changes to source code, detracting from their widespread application. In this work, we present an open source system that automates the quantitative analysis of floating point rounding errors through the use of C-based source-to-source compilation and a Monte Carlo arithmetic library. We demonstrate its application to the comparison of algorithms, detection of catastrophic cancellation, and determination of whether single precision floating point provides sufficient accuracy for a given application. Methods for obtaining quantifiable measurements of sensitivity to rounding error are also detailed.",

    "abstract": "Emotion recognition from facial images is a very active research topic in human computer interaction (HCI). However, most of the previous approaches only focus on the frontal or nearly frontal view facial images. In contrast to the frontal/nearly-frontal view images, emotion recognition from non-frontal view or even arbitrary view facial images is much more difficult yet of more practical utility. To handle the emotion recognition problem from arbitrary view facial images, in this paper we propose a novel method based on the regional covariance matrix (RCM) representation of facial images. We also develop a new discriminant analysis theory, aiming at reducing the dimensionality of the facial feature vectors while preserving the most discriminative information, by minimizing an estimated multiclass Bayes error derived under the Gaussian mixture model (GMM). We further propose an efficient algorithm to solve the optimal discriminant vectors of the proposed discriminant analysis method. We render thousands of multi-view 2D facial images from the BU-3DFE database and conduct extensive experiments on the generated database to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method. It is worth noting that our method does not require face alignment or facial landmark points localization, making it very attractive.",

Language classes, (i,j)LL and (i,j)ML, of (i,j) linear languages and (i,j) minimal linear languages are defined by posing restrictions on the form of production rules and the number of nonterminals. Then the homomorphic characterizations of the class of recursively enumerable languages are obtained using these classes and a class, ML, of minimal linear languages. That is, for any recursively enumerable language L over \u03a3, an alphabet \u0394, a homomorphism h:\u0394\u2217\u2192\u03a3\u2217 and two languages L1 and L2 over \u0394 in some classes mentioned above can be found such that L=h(L1\u2229L2).

    "abstract": "In the context of static analysis via abstract interpretation, convex polyhedra constitute the most used abstract domain among those capturing numerical relational information. Since the domain of convex polyhedra admits infinite ascending chains, it has to be used in conjunction with appropriate mechanisms for enforcing and accelerating the convergence of fixpoint computations. Widening operators provide a simple and general characterization for such mechanisms. For the domain of convex polyhedra, the original widening operator proposed by Cousot and Halbwachs amply deserves the name of standard widening since most analysis and verification tools that employ convex polyhedra also employ that operator. Nonetheless, there is an unfulfilled demand for more precise widening operators. In this paper, after a formal introduction to the standard widening where we clarify some aspects that are often overlooked, we embark on the challenging task of improving on it. We present a framework for the systematic definition of new widening operators that are never less precise than a given widening. The framework is then instantiated on the domain of convex polyhedra so as to obtain a new widening operator that improves on the standard widening by combining several heuristics. A preliminary experimental evaluation has yielded promising results. We also suggest an improvement to the well-known widening delay technique that allows one to gain precision while preserving its overall simplicity.",

The emergence of non-local, irregular communication patterns generated by these algorithms can easily create an insurmountable bottleneck on supercomputers with hundreds of thousands of cores. To overcome this obstacle we have developed an innovative parallelization strategy for Barnes\u2013Hut tree codes on present and upcoming HPC multicore architectures. This scheme, based on a combined MPI\u2013Pthreads approach, permits an efficient overlap of computation and data exchange. We highlight the capabilities of this method on the full IBM Blue Gene/P system JUGENE at Julich Supercomputing Centre and demonstrate scaling across 294,912 cores with up to 2,048,000,000 particles.

    "abstract": "Point-of-interest (POI) recommendation becomes a valuable service in location-based social networks. Based on the norm that similar users are likely to have similar preference of POIs, the current recommendation techniques mainly focus on users' preference to provide accurate recommendation results. This tends to generate a list of homogeneous POIs that are clustered into a narrow band of location categories (like food, museum, etc.) in a city. However, users are more interested to taste a wide range of flavors that are exposed in a global set of location categories in the city. In this paper, we formulate a new POI recommendation problem, namely top-K location category based POI recommendation, by introducing information coverage to encode the location categories of POIs in a city.

    "abstract": "Detecting duplicate bug reports helps reduce triaging efforts and save time for developers in fixing the same issues. Among several automated detection approaches, text-based information retrieval (IR) approaches have been shown to outperform others in term of both accuracy and time efficiency. However, those IR-based approaches do not detect well the duplicate reports on the same technical issues written in different descriptive terms.     This paper introduces DBTM, a duplicate bug report detection approach that takes advantage of both IR-based features and topic-based features. DBTM models a bug report as a textual document describing certain technical issue(s), and models duplicate bug reports as the ones about the same technical issue(s). Trained with historical data including identified duplicate reports, it is able to learn the sets of different terms describing the same technical issues and to detect other not-yet-identified duplicate ones. Our empirical evaluation on real-world systems shows that DBTM improves the state-of-the-art approaches by up to 20% in accuracy.",

There is general accord that context can be affluent derivation of information about an illumination, character and diversity of object. However, the problem of how to customize contextual influence is not yet solved clearly. Here we describe a naive probabilistic method for modeling and testing the images of eye patterns. The proposed eye location method employs context-driven adaptive Bayesian framework to relive the effect due to uneven condition of face image. Based on an easy holistic analysis of face images, the proposed method is able to exactly locate eye position.

One particular aspect of these social networks widely discussed in the news and heavily researched in academic circles is the privacy of their users. In this paper we introduce six new privacy leaks in Facebook and Twitter. First, we reveal how an attacker can map users email addresses to their real names using Facebook's account recovery service. This mapping helps an attacker accumulate more information about the holder of an email address which could then be used to launch targeted spam attacks. Second, we introduce how an attacker can reconstruct the friend list of a victim on Facebook, even though that user's privacy setting does not allow the attacker to explicitly view the victim's friend list. Third, we show the additional privacy leaks due to the introduction of Facebook's Timeline. Fourth, we show how the unprecedented connectivity offered by social plugins breaches a user's privacy. Fifth, we introduce the social network relay attacks. Sixth, we show how an attacker can permanently withhold a victim's Facebook account after the first take over. Moreover, we propose solutions for each of these privacy leaks.",

    "abstract": "Vector quantization (VQ) is a widely used technique for many applications especially for lossy image compression. Since VQ significantly reduces the size of a digital image, it can save the costs of storage space and image delivery. Search-order coding (SOC) was proposed for improving the performance of VQ in terms of compression rate. However, SOC requires extra data (i.e. indicators) to indicate source of codewords so the compression rate may be affected. To overcome such a drawback, in this paper, a search-order coding with the indicator-elimination property was proposed by using a technique of reversible data hiding. The proposed method is the first one using such a concept of data hiding to achieve a better compression rate of SOC. From experimental results, the performance of the SOC method can be successfully improved by the proposed indicator eliminated search-order coding method in terms of compression rate. In addition, compared with other relevant schemes, the proposed method is also more flexible than some existing schemes.",

Completing the proof of correctness requires a significant body of group theory and computational number theory to be formalized in the theorem prover.

    "abstract": "Voltage scaling is a promising approach to reduce the power consumption in signal processing circuits. However aggressive voltage scaling can introduce errors in the output signal, thus degrading the algorithmic performance of the circuit. We consider the specific case of the finite impulse response (FIR) filter, and identify two different sources of errors occurring due to voltage scaling: (a) errors introduced because of increased delay along the logic path and (b) errors caused by failures in the memory due to process variations. We design a FIR filter by using a simple feedback based approach to reduce the memory errors and a linear predictor structure for correcting the logic errors. The proposed filter is more robust to both logic and memory errors caused by voltage scaling. The results show a considerable improvement in the output Signal to Noise ratio (at least around 10 dB) for a probability of error (P err ) even as high as 0.5. We also utilize the proposed technique for an image filtering application and observe a considerable improvement in the visual quality of the output image along with an improvement of over 10 dB in the Peak Signal to Noise ratio for P err  as high as 0.5.",

Yet it is extremely challenging to build indexing and browsing tools for video data, particularly when it involves interactive motions of multiple objects. The problem is further complicated when the video archives are dynamically updated, and/or queries contains partial information. An efficient solution would require that the feature space used to represent the data be dynamically updated or downdated to allow frequent additions/deletions and matching of queries. Assuming Tensor HOSVD as the feature space, in this paper, we propose two novel algorithms, namely, Dynamic Tensor HOSVD Updating Algorithm (DTSV D + ) and Dynamic Tensor HOSVD Downdating Algorithm (DTSV D \u2212 ), for dynamically updating and downdating existing tensor HOSVD, without recalculating it from the raw data. The proposed algorithms are robustly applied to both full and partial multiple motion trajectories events with varying number of objects, trajectory lengths, and sampling rates. Simulations on real-world multiple motion trajectories data demonstrate the robustness and accuracy of the proposed algorithms.",

    "abstract": "Effects of inter-element spacing on reflectarray unit cell design are studied in this paper. Reflectarray unit cells were commonly analyzed using a waveguide approach which assumed a fixed separation between identical elements in an infinite array. However, in practice, a reflectarray element can be surrounded by non-identical elements with variable distances. It is shown in this paper that the resonant frequency and reflection phase of the reflectarray element noticeably change with respect to different element spacing. A reflectarray unit cell is designed at 2.056 GHz. By changing the distance between the reflectarray elements from 0.33 to 0.68 \u03bb 0  in E plane and 0.33 to 0.78 \u03bb 0  in H plane, the resonant frequency is increased from 1.99 to 2.07 GHz (representing a 4% change) and the reflection phase is shifted by 200\u00b0. To prove the concept, two 3 \u00d7 3 subarrays with different inter-element spacing are fabricated. The measurement results closely agree with simulated responses. The knowledge gained in this work can make the design of reflectarray antenna more accurate.",

Thus, there have been many paradigms developed to decrease the complexity of the de Bruijn graph. One obvious combinatorial paradigm for this is to allow the value of k to vary; having a larger value of k where the graph is more complex and a smaller value of k where the graph would likely contain fewer spurious edges and vertices. One open problem that affects the practicality of this method is how to predict the value of k prior to building the de Bruijn graph. We show that optimal values of k can be predicted prior to assembly by using the information contained in a phylogenetically-close genome and therefore, help make the use of multiple values of k practical for genome assembly.",

    "abstract": "Analysis supported by interactive visual interfaces is a complex process. It involves computational analytics (the visualization of both raw and derived data) and an analytical process which requires a human to extract knowledge from the data by directly interacting and manipulating both the visual and analytical components of the system. These two types of analytics are complementary and the goal of this paper is to understand interplay between the two. In this paper we discuss how a study of human reasoning and reasoning-supported cognitive processes complement the current emphasis on computational analysis and visualization. We define this process as reasoning analytics and present mechanisms by which this process may be studied.",

    "abstract": "In this paper, the semilocal convergence of a third order Stirling-like method used to find fixed points of nonlinear operator equations in Banach spaces is established under the assumption that the first Frechet derivative of the involved operator satisfies ?-continuity condition. It turns out that this convergence condition is weaker than the Lipschitz and the Holder continuity conditions on first Frechet derivative of the involved operator. The importance of our work lies in the fact that numerical examples can be given to show that our approach is successful even in cases where Lipschitz and Holder continuity conditions on first Frechet derivative fail. It also avoids the evaluation of second order Frechet derivative which is difficult to compute at times. A priori error bounds along with the domains of existence and uniqueness of a fixed point are derived. The R-order of the method is shown to be equal to (2p?+?1) for p???(0,1]. Finally, two numerical examples involving nonlinear integral equations are worked out to show the efficacy of our approach.",

    "abstract": "Spectrum leasing is a novel promising technique to improve the spectrum efficiency (SE) through the spectrum owner leasing its free or under-utilization spectrum to unlicensed users for superfluous spectrum revenue, while the unlicensed users should pay for spectrum renting. Recently, spectrum leasing is used between femtocell service provider (FSP) and the coexisting macrocell service provider (MSP) in heterogeneous networks (HetNets). However, the energy efficiency (EE), a critical performance metric in HetNets, especially when multiple FSPs are densely overlaid on the coverage of MSP, has been largely neglected in available SE-oriented spectrum leasing. In this paper, a cooperative spectrum leasing framework is proposed to both mitigate interference and save energy, where a Stackelberg coordination game is formulated to analyze a joint spectrum leasing, pricing and interference coordination process between FSPs and MSP with the novel energy-aware utility functions for the players of FSPs and MSP. We rigorously derive the optimal closed-form solutions of spectrum leasing, pricing, and power coordination solutions for the FSP and the MSP. We propose a multi-stage distributed algorithm to approach these solutions. Finally, simulation results are provided to clarify effects of multiple parameters in the gaming process and verify the final improved performance.",

Our recognition system allows quantitative comparison of similarities among manipulations performed by observing contact state transitions on a palm surface. The system detects the contact states on the palm surface using an attached tactile sensor sheet on a manipulated object. In experiments, familiarization and fatigue are detected by measuring the variance of the manipulation. Experimental results indicate that manipulation can be divided into three periods: learning, familiarization, and fatigue. The results also indicate that variation of the manipulation becomes small when the template is generated by manipulation data during the familiarization period.",

    "abstract": "The tectonic movement along faults is often reflected by geomorphological features such as linear valleys, ridgelines and slope-breaks, steep slopes of uniform aspect, regional anisotropy and tilt of terrain. In the last years, remote sensing data have been used as a source of information for the detection of tectonic structures. In this paper, a new fully 3D approach for semi-automatic extraction and characterization of geological lineaments is presented: linear features are detected on a DTM by means of algorithms based on principal curvature values, and then they are grouped according to data collected from literature review regarding expected orientation of lineaments in the studied area. The overall positive aspects of this semi-automatic process were found to be the informativeness on geological structure for preliminary geological assessment and set identification, the possibility to identify the most interesting portions to be investigated and to analyze zones that are not directly accessible. This method has been applied to a geologically well-known area (the Monferrato geological domain) in order to validate the results of the software processing with remotely sensed data collected from literature review. As regard to orientation, spatial distribution and length of the lineaments, the study demonstrates a correspondence of the obtained results with both remote sensed linear features and field geostructural data.",

    "abstract": "In recent years, one of the effective engines for perceptual organization of low-level image features is based on the partitioning of a graph representation that captures Gestalt inspired local structures, such as similarity, proximity, continuity, parallelism, and perpendicularity, over the low-level image features. Mainly motivated by computational efficiency considerations, this graph partitioning process is usually implemented as a recursive bipartitioning process, where, at each step, the graph is broken into two parts based on a partitioning measure. We focus on three such measures, namely, the minimum, average, and normalized cuts. The minimum cut partition seeks to minimize the total link weights cut. The average cut measure is proportional to the total link weight cut, normalized by the sizes of the partitions. The normalized cut measure is normalized by the product of the total connectivity (valencies) of the nodes in each partition. We provide theoretical and empirical insight into the nature of the three partitioning measures in terms of the underlying image statistics. In particular, we consider for what kinds of image statistics would optimizing a measure, irrespective of the particular algorithm used, result in correct partitioning. Are the quality of the groups significantly different for each cut measure? Are there classes of images for which grouping by partitioning does not work well? Also, can the recursive bipartitioning strategy separate out groups corresponding to K objects from each other? In the analysis, we draw from probability theory and the rich body of work on stochastic ordering of random variables. Our major conclusion is that optimization of none of the three measures is guaranteed to result in the correct partitioning of K objects, in the strict stochastic order sense, for all image statistics.",

If a coloring is embeddable, its automorphisms are all induced by affine transformations; this is used to study colorings with doubly transitive automorphism groups. Connections with coding theory, elliptic geometry, and difference sets are mentioned.",

The novel mechanism designing enable the centroid of the robot concentrate on the hip joint to minimize the drive toque of hip joint and keep the robot stable during the single-support phase. And the centroid of the robot will be adjusted to concentrate to the other leg to start a new single-support phase.

    "abstract": "The problem of acoustic modeling for continuous speech recognition is addressed. To deal with coarticulation effects and interspeaker variability, an extension of the mixture stochastic trajectory model (MSTM) is proposed. MSTM is a segment-based model using phonemes as speech units. In MSTM, the observations of a phoneme are modeled by a set of stochastic trajectories. The trajectories are modeled by a mixture of probability density functions (pdf) of state sequences. Each state is associated with a multivariate Gaussian density function. We propose to replace the state single Gaussian pdf by a mixture of Gaussian pdfs (MSTM with state-mixture, SM-MSTM). The parameters of the model are estimated under the ML criterion, using the expectation-maximisation (EM) algorithm. The tests of the system on a speaker-dependent continuous speech recognition task show a reduction in the word error rate by about 15% over the baseline MSTM, even for an equal number of parameters. Experiments based on a multispeaker continuous speech recognition task do not lead to significant improvement over the baseline system.",

    "abstract": "Interactive ad hoc data query over massive datasets has recently gained significant traction. Massively parallel data query and analysis frameworks (e.g., Dremel, Impala) are built and deployed to support SQL-like queries over distributed and partitioned data in a clustering environment. As a result, the execution of each query is converted into a set of coordinated tasks including data retrieval, intermediate result computation and transfer, and result aggregation. To support high request rate of concurrent interactive queries, coordinated management of multiple resources (e.g., bandwidth, CPU, memory) of the cluster environment is critical. In this paper, we investigate this resource management problem using an utility-based optimization framework. Our goal is to optimize the resource utilization, and maintain fairness among different types of queries. We present a price-based algorithm which achieves this optimization objective. We implement our algorithm in the open source Impala system and conduct a set of experiments in a clustering environment using the TPC-DS workload. Experimental results show that our coordinated resource management solution can increase the aggregate utility by at least 15.4% compared with simple fair resource share mechanism, and 63.5% compared with the FIFO resource management mechanism.",

Therefore, it is vital to comprehend the requirements of female users and their preferences. In order to exploit the market, the demands and preferences of female consumers for websites therefore need to be explored. When the information and advertising full of the shopping site, it will lead the female users distraction. Designers and websites developers require to know how to adjust the interface design for female users. This study accommodate the issue how to develope a usable, pleasant and efficient web interface to provide better online shopping experiences for female users. This study aims to discuss the demands and preference of female consumers in order to enhance the usability of shopping website. Payeasy, having females as the major consumers, was ranked on the top of electronic commerce in 2013 in Taiwan. For this reason, it is taken as the research sample. The Introduction interface in the shopping website is explored. This research is divided into two stages. First, two common types of introduction allocation horizontal on top, vertical at left are organized from literatures. With classical work settings, the preference of female consumers for the website design would be explored. Second, the questionnaire survey is used for evaluating the layout and text distinguishability.

    "abstract": "Recovering directed pathways of information transfer between brain areas is an important issue in neuroscience and helps to shed light on the brain function in several physiological and cognitive states. Granger causality (GC) analysis is a valuable tool to detect directed dynamical connectivity, and it is being increasingly used. Unfortunately, this approach encounters some limitations in particularly when applied to neuroimaging datasets, often consisting in short and noisy data and for which redundancy plays an important role. In this article, we address one of these limitations, namely, the computational and conceptual problems arising when conditional GC, necessary to disambiguate direct and mediated influences, is used on short and noisy datasets of many variables, as it is typically the case in some electroencephalography (EEG) protocols and in functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI). We show that considering GC in the framework of information theory we can limit the conditioning to a limited number of variables chosen as the most informative, obtaining more stable and reliable results both in EEG and fMRI data.",

    "abstract": "This paper presents a mode switching feedback (FB) compensation methodology based on rolling friction models for the fast and precise positioning of table drive systems. Rolling friction in the table drive mechanisms behaves as a nonlinear elastic component in the micro displacement region and deteriorates the position settling performance with slow responses. Effects of the rolling friction on the positioning, therefore, should be compensated to provide the desired control performance. The authors have already proposed a rolling friction model-based friction compensation scheme to improve the slow settling responses. The conventional approach, however, could not suppress vibratory settling responses due to unknown model errors and/or plant perturbations, and there still remains the performance deterioration in the positioning accuracy to be solved. In this research, therefore, a novel mode switching FB compensation considering the rolling friction properties is applied to provide the desired settling performance with well-suppression of both vibratory response and slow response. The feature of the proposed approach is that the vibratory and slow responses at the settling are handled as an initial value response of the FB control system in the micro displacement region and can be suppressed in a mode switching control manner on the basis of initial value compensation frameworks utilizing the elastic characteristic of the rolling friction. The proposed approach has been verified by numerical simulations and experiments using a prototype of industrial table positioning devices.",

Furthermore, a mobile node does not require modifications in order to use these mobile services. While our approach provides rapid deployment and supports both IP and non-IP protocols, only a subset of mobile usage scenarios are offered. In other words, our approach does not solve all the problems of mobility. We discuss the characteristics of mobility usage, and we list the scenarios our approach supports. We believe that the mobile usage scenarios supported by this method are some of the more common usage scenarios.

    "abstract": "We describe a simple approach to named-entity recognition (NER), aimed initially at the Dutch language, but potentially applicable to other languages. Our NER system employs a two-stage architecture, with handcrafted but dataset-independent features for both stages, and is on a par with state-of-the-art systems described in the literature. Notably, our approach does not depend on language-specific assets such as gazetteers. The resulting system is quite fast and is implemented in less than 500 lines of code.",

    "abstract": "Detecting splicing traces in the tampering color space is usually a tough work. However, it is found that image splicing which is difficult to be detected in one color space is probably much easier to be detected in another one. In this paper, an efficient approach for passive color image splicing detection is proposed. Chroma spaces are introduced in our work compared with commonly used RGB and luminance spaces. Four gray level run-length run-number (RLRN) vectors with different directions extracted from de-correlated chroma channels are employed as distinguishing features for image splicing detection. Support vector machine (SVM) is used as a classifier to demonstrate the performance of the proposed feature extraction method. Experimental results have shown that that RLRN features extracted from chroma channels provide much better performance than that extracted from R, G, B and luminance channels.",

    "abstract": "Estimating the head pose plays an important role in computer vision and also as a key task for visual surveillance and face recognition applications hence a prominent problem in computer vision. Most of the works in this field suffer from lack of continuous estimating of the head pose and high accuracy. We know fuzzy systems as universal approximator capable of approximating an unknown function by having just few limited information while attaining high accuracy. In this paper, an improved approach is proposed for estimating the rotation angle of the head along horizontal axis based on a fuzzy approximator in which the membership functions are of Gaussian type. The proposed method is able to provide a continuous estimate of the head along horizontal axis with high accuracy, low computational cost while avoiding from getting involved into complex mathematical equations. Experiments on images from two standard well-known databases showed less than 6\u00b0 of average absolute error in estimation which is a significant improvement over the approximator with simple triangular membership functions.",

Proposed approach allows determining the critical charge according to the dynamic behavior of the temperature as a function of the voltage scaling. Experimental results show that both temperature and voltage scaling can increase in at least two times the susceptibility of SRAM cells to soft error rate (SER). In addition, a model for electrical simulation for soft error and different voltages was described to investigate the effects observed in the practical neutron irradiation experiments. Results can guide designers to predict soft error effects during the lifetime of SRAM-based devices considering different power supply modes.",

    "abstract": "The streaming model is a popular model for writing high-throughput parallel applications. A streaming application is represented by a graph of computation stages that communicate with each other via FIFO channels. In this paper, we consider the problem of mapping streaming pipelines - streaming applications where the graph is a linear chain - onto a set of computing resources in order to maximize its throughput. In a parallel setting, subsets of stages, called components, can be mapped onto different computing resources. The throughput of an application is determined by the throughput of the slowest component. Therefore, if some stage is much slower than others, then it may be useful to replicate the stage's code and divide its workload among two or more replicas in order to increase throughput. However, pipelines may consist of some replicable and some non-replicable stages. In this paper, we address the problem of mapping these partially replicable streaming pipelines onto both homogeneous and heterogeneous platforms so as to maximize throughput. We consider two types of platforms, homogeneous platforms - where all resources are identical, and heterogeneous platforms - where resources may have different speeds. In both cases, we consider two network topologies-unidirectional chain and clique. We provide polynomial-time algorithms for mapping partially replicable pipelines onto unidirectional chains for both homogeneous and heterogeneous platforms. For homogeneous platforms, the algorithm for unidirectional chains generalizes to clique topologies. However, for heterogeneous platforms, mapping these pipelines onto clique topologies is NP-complete. We provide heuristics to generate solutions for cliques by applying our chain algorithms to a series of chains sampled from the clique. Our empirical results show that these heuristics rapidly converge to near-optimal solutions.",

    "abstract": "Pronking (aka. stotting) is a gait in which all legs are used in synchrony, resulting in long flight phases and large jumping heights that may potentially be useful for mobile robots on rough terrain. Robotic instantiations of this gait suffer from severe pitch instability either due to underactuation, or the lack of sufficient feedback. Nevertheless, the dynamic nature of this gait suggests that the Spring-Loaded Inverted Pendulum Model (SLIP), a very successful predictive model for both natural and robotic runners, would be a good basis for more robust and maneuverable robotic pronking. In this paper, we describe how \u201ctemplate-based control\u201d, a controller structure based on the embedding of a simple dynamical \u201ctemplate\u201d within a more complex \u201canchor\u201d system, can be used to achieve stable and controllable pronking for a planar, underactuated hexapod model. In this context, high-level control of the gait is regulated through speed and height commands to the SLIP template, while the embedding controller based on approximate inverse-dynamics and carefully designed passive dynamics ensures the stability of the remaining degrees of freedom. We show through extensive simulation experiments that unlike existing open-loop alternatives, the resulting control structure provides stability, explicit maneuverability and significant robustness against sensor and actuator noise.",

    "abstract": "There is considerable freedom in choosing the sensors to be equipped on a robot. Currently many sensing technologies are available (radar, lidar, vision sensors, time-of-flight cameras, etc.). For each class, there are additional choices regarding the exact sensor parameters (spatial resolution, frame rate, etc.). Which sensor is best? In general, this question needs to be qualified. It depends on the task. In an estimation task, the answer depends on the prior for the signal. In a control task, the answer depends exactly on which are the sufficient statistics for computing the control signal. This paper shows that an ulterior qualification that needs to be made: the answer depends on the power available for sensing, even when the task is fixed. We define the \u201cpower-performance\u201d curve as the performance attainable on a task for a given level of sensing power. We show that this approach is well suited to comparing a traditional CMOS sensor with the recently available \u201cneuromorphic\u201d sensors. We discuss estimation tasks with different priors for the signal. We find priors for which one sensor dominates the other and vice-versa, priors for which they are equivalent, and priors for which the answer depends on the power available. This shows that comparing sensors is a quite delicate problem. It also suggests that the optimal architecture might have more that one sensor, and would switch sensors on and off according to the performance level required instantaneously.",

    "abstract": "The advent of multicore architectures is a good incentive to better understand base synchronization mechanisms. This paper, which can be considered as a simple introduction to the topic, presents (with a pedagogical flavor) the concept of rendezvous (also called interaction, synchronous communication, or logically instantaneous communication) and several implementations of it. This abstraction adds synchronization to communication, namely, it requires that, for a message to be sent by a process, the receiver has to be ready to receive it. From an external observer point view, the message transmission looks like instantaneous: the sending and the reception of a message appear as being a single event (and the sense of the communication could have been in the other direction). From an operational point of view, we have the following: for each pair of processes, the first process that wants to communicate - be it the sender or the receiver - has to. wait until the other process is ready to communicate.",

    "abstract": "We propose a new coherent framework for joint object detection, 3D layout estimation, and object supporting region segmentation from a single image. Our approach is based on the mutual interactions among three novel modules: (i) object detector; (ii) scene 3D layout estimator; (iii) object supporting region segmenter. The interactions between such modules capture the contextual geometrical relationship between objects, the physical space including these objects, and the observer. An important property of our algorithm is that the object detector module is capable of adaptively changing its confidence in establishing whether a certain region of interest contains an object (or not) as new evidence is gathered about the scene layout. This enables an iterative estimation procedure where the detector becomes more and more accurate as additional evidence about a specific scene becomes available. Extensive quantitative and qualitative experiments are conducted on the table-top dataset (Sun et al. in ECCV, 2010b) and two publicly available datasets (Hoiem et al. in CVPR, 2006; Sudderth et al. in IJCV, 2008), and demonstrate competitive object detection, 3D layout estimation, and segmentation results.",

It poses two important challenges, the need for simple yet effective policy design and an implementation that scales to billions of files. This paper describes the design and an innovative implementation technique of policy-based lifecycle management in a prototype built as a part of IBM's new SAN file system. The policy specification leverages a key abstraction in the file system called storage pools and its ability to support location independence for files. The policy implementation uses an innovative new technique that combines concurrent policy execution and a policy decisions cache, to enable scaling to billions of files under normal usage patterns.",

    "abstract": "This article focuses on automatically generating polynomial equations that are inductive loop invariants of computer programs. We propose a new algorithm for this task, which is based on polynomial interpolation. Though the proposed algorithm is not complete, it is efficient and can be applied to a broader range of problems compared to existing methods targeting similar problems. The efficiency of our approach is testified by experiments on a large collection of programs. The current implementation of our method is based on dense interpolation, for which a total degree bound is needed. On the theoretical front, we study the degree and dimension of the invariant ideal of loops which have no branches and where the assignments define a P-solvable recurrence. In addition, we obtain sufficient conditions for non-trivial polynomial equation invariants to exist (resp. not to exist).",

    "abstract": "Relative merits of sigma point Kalman filters (SPKF), also known as unscented Kalman filters (UKF) vis-a-vis extended Kalman filter (EKF) and iterated extended Kalman filter (IEKF) for a bearing-only target-tracking problem using rms error and robustness with respect to outlier initial conditions are explored. After establishing that the rms error performance obtainable by SPKF/UKF and IEKF for this fairly severe non-linear system is similar to those obtainable from other competing techniques, the relative robustness of IEKF, SPKF/UKF and EKF with respect to large initial condition uncertainty (a common occurrence for this class of tracking problems) is investigated. Using several versions of SPKF/UKF, it is shown that SPKF is about 20 times more robust compared to EKF. It is illustrated that the additional design freedom available with a sealed version of SPKF/UKF may be utilised for further improvement of the robustness. The main contribution of this paper is quantification of relative robustness of these non-linear filters. A simplified criterion is suggested and used for quantifying track loss and the relative occurrence of such track loss in batch Monte Carlo simulation has been used as a measure of (lack of) robustness. As the SPKF/UKF does not introduce substantial computational burden, when compared to EKF, it is argued that SPKF/UKF algorithm may become a strong candidate for on-board implementation.",

Moreover, the beginning and finishing times of the resource availability periods are subject to some uncertainties since the machines are directly administrated by the owners (and thus, there is no global centralized control). The performance of the applications is achieved by a suitable adaptation of the algorithms to the volunteer environments. We propose an efficient method that optimizes the performance and reduces the impact of disturbances by means of stability. Stability gives the guarantee that the disturbed solution does not differ too much from the initial solution. It is obtained on the basis of a reputation mechanism of the resources that makes the scheduling decisions more adequate. The quality of our algorithm is demonstrated by a campaign of experiments using simulations of actual traces of BOINC where the results are compared to other existing reference algorithms.",

    "abstract": "Peer Data Management Systems (PDMS) provide data sharing between heterogeneous databases using peer-to- peer schema mapping, where intermediate peers are used to translate the queries as well as the query results. However, such translation leaks not only the exchanged data but also the private mapping information used by intermediate peers for translation. The privacy of such information is critical in most applications, specially in healthcare. Researchers have proposed to inject dummy values into the query result to confuse the adversary. However, existing solutions overlooked the privacy of the exchanged query. Furthermore, they can only provide partial privacy for the private mapping information and are computationally expensive. This paper presents a novel privacy preserving query answering protocol for PDMS using query decoupling and random value mapping encoding. The former decouples the query and the query result to prevent the leakage of sensitive data, while the latter randomly encodes the private value mappings. The analytical and experimental results confirm that the proposed protocol provides better privacy and also removes the need for expensive commutative encryption, thus greatly reducing the computation overhead.",

    "abstract": "Ribonucleic acid (RNA) molecules play important roles in a variety of biological processes. To properly function, RNA molecules usually have to fold to specific structures, and therefore understanding RNA structure is vital in comprehending how RNA functions. One approach to understanding and predicting biomolecular structure is to use knowledge-based potentials built from experimentally determined structures. These types of potentials have been shown to be effective for predicting both protein and RNA structures, but their utility is limited by their significantly rugged nature. This ruggedness (and hence the potential's usefulness) depends heavily on the choice of bin width to sort structural information (e.g. distances) but the appropriate bin width is not known a priori. To circumvent the binning problem, we compared knowledge-based potentials built from inter-atomic distances in RNA structures using different mixture models (Kernel Density Estimation, Expectation Minimization and Dirichlet Process). We show that the smooth knowledge-based potential built from Dirichlet process is successful in selecting native-like RNA models from different sets of structural decoys with comparable efficacy to a potential developed by spline-fitting \u2014 a commonly taken approach \u2014 to binned distance histograms. The less rugged nature of our potential suggests its applicability in diverse types of structural modeling.",

    "abstract": "Mobile cloud computing (MCC) is an emerging paradigm to transparently provide support for demanding tasks on resource-constrained mobile devices by relying on the integration with remote cloud services. Research in this field is tackling the multiple conceptual and technical challenges (e.g., how and when to offload) that are hindering the full realization of MCC. The NAM framework is a general tool to describe networks of hardware and software autonomic entities, providing or consuming services or resources, that can be applied to MCC scenarios. In this paper, we focus on NAM's features related to the key aspects of MCC, in particular those concerning code mobility capabilities and autonomic offloading strategies. Our first contribution is the definition of a restricted set of mobility actions supporting MCC. The second contribution is a formal semantics for those actions, which allows us to better understand the behavior of MCC systems and paves the way for the application of formal reasoning techniques. As an outcome, we also derive a more precise formalization of the core NAM features, which may contribute to further development of that framework and the related middleware.",

    "abstract": "Structural and diffusion imaging studies demonstrate effects of age, sex, and asymmetry in many brain structures. However, few studies have addressed how individual differences might influence the structural integrity of the superficial white matter (SWM), comprised of short-range association (U-fibers), and intracortical axons. This study thus applied a sophisticated computational analysis approach to structural and diffusion imaging data obtained from healthy individuals selected from the International Consortium for Brain Mapping (ICBM) database across a wide adult age range (n=65, age: 18\u201374 years, all Caucasian). Fractional anisotropy (FA), radial diffusivity (RD), and axial diffusivity (AD) were sampled and compared at thousands of spatially matched SWM locations and within regions-of-interest to examine global and local variations in SWM integrity across age, sex, and hemisphere. Results showed age-related reductions in FA that were more pronounced in the frontal SWM than in the posterior and ventral brain regions, whereas increases in RD and AD were observed across large areas of the SWM. FA was significantly greater in left temporoparietal regions in men and in the posterior callosum in women. Prominent leftward FA and rightward AD and RD asymmetries were observed in the temporal, parietal, and frontal regions. Results extend previous findings restricted to the deep white matter pathways to demonstrate regional changes in the SWM microstructure relating to processes of demyelination and/or to the number, coherence, or integrity of axons with increasing age. SWM fiber organization/coherence appears greater in the left hemisphere regions spanning language and other networks, while more localized sex effects could possibly reflect sex-specific advantages in information strategies.",

    "abstract": "Model-based feedback control of vibration in flexible structures can be complicated by the possibility that interaction with an external body occurs. If not accounted for, instability or poor performance may result. In this paper, a method is proposed for achieving robust vibration control of flexible structures under contact. The method uses robust linear state feedback, coupled with a state estimation scheme utilizing contact force measurement. Uncertain contact characteristics are modelled by a sector-bounded non-linear function, such that state feedback gains can be synthesized using a matrix inequality formulation of the Popov stability criterion. A separation theorem is used to establish a robust H\"2 cost bound for the closed loop system. Experimental results from a multi-mode flexible structure testbed confirm that vibration attenuation and stability can be maintained over a broad range of contact characteristics, in terms of compliance and clearance.",

The second topic concerns techniques for generating custom tours for electronic city-guide systems. Guide generates these custom tours by taking into account multiple contextual triggers and user preferences. In practice, producing good tours and, indeed, assessing the quality of a tour are difficult tasks.

    "abstract": "We compare and contrast situation awareness in cyber warfare and in conventional, kinetic warfare. Situation awareness (SA) has a far longer history of study and applications in such areas as control of complex enterprises and in conventional warfare, than in cyber warfare. Far more is known about the SA in conventional military conflicts, or adversarial engagements, than in cyber ones. By exploring what is known about SA in conventional, also commonly referred to as kinetic, battles, we may gain insights and research directions relevant to cyber conflicts. We discuss the nature of SA in conventional (often called kinetic) conflict, review what is known about this kinetic SA (KSA), and then offer a comparison with what is currently understood regarding the cyber SA (CSA). We find that challenges and opportunities of KSA and CSA are similar or at least parallel in several important ways. With respect to similarities, in both kinetic and cyber worlds, SA strongly impacts the outcome of the mission. Also similarly, cognitive biases are found in both KSA and CSA. As an example of differences, KSA often relies on commonly accepted, widely used organizing representation - map of the physical terrain of the battlefield. No such common representation has emerged in CSA, yet.",

We present analytical results investigating the 'hidden terminal jamming' ability of the IEEE 802.11 DSSS physical layer. Results indicate that in a hidden terminal topology, the presence of an interfering transmission with a signal strength marginally greater than the transmission currently being received will result in an intolerable increase in BER, effectively jamming the ongoing transmission. These results confirm previous experimental measurements which show that after a number of MAC layer timeout/retransmission periods, the original (weaker) connection is effectively prevented from gaining access to the channel.",

Given enough activity at the periphery, the HVS is then capable to foveate to the next region of interest (ROI), to attend to it at full resolution. Saliency models in the past have focused on identifying features that can be used in a bottom-up manner to generate conspicuity maps, which are then combined together to provide regions of fixated interest. However, these models neglect to take into consideration the foveal relation of an object of interest. The model proposed in this work aims to compute saliency as a function of distance from a given fixation point, using a multi-resolution framework.

Practical application to the raw meal calcination process has shown that when the raw meal flow varies frequently this control strategy can not only ensure that the calciner temperature can be guaranteed within its required ranges, but also control outlet temperature of preheater C5 at the level that the outlet temperature of preheater C5 is less than the maximum value.

    "abstract": "Proximity, a vague spatial relationship between a reference object (RO) and a located object (LO), has been shown to be influenced by many contextual factors rather than determined solely by the Euclidean distance between RO and LO. In this paper, a list of potential contextual factors that may influence how human conceptualize proximity was reviewed. Focusing on RO, LO, and geographical context we adopted a web-based corpus method by crawling the Web to build a spatial language corpus on linguistically specified proximity relationships. Spatial named entity recognition and entity resolution were used to extract RO, LO, and contextual factors out from the corpus. By mapping and analyzing the correlation between distance and contextual factors, this study provides insights on how different contextual factors influence the conceptualization of spatial proximity.",

Mathematical justifications of the new formulation and method are established. Details on algorithm implementation are presented. Examples for two very different variational PDE problems are carried out to illustrate the method. Their numerical results are displayed by profile-contour plots and error/convergence data. The formulation and method developed in this paper can also be applied to solve multiple fixed point problems.",

    "abstract": "Many mechanisms based on bandwidth reservation have been proposed in the literature to decrease connection dropping probability for handoffs in cellular communications. The handoff events occur at a much higher rate in sectored cellular networks than in traditional cellular systems. An efficient bandwidth reservation mechanism for the neighboring cells is therefore critical in the process of handoff during the connection of multimedia calls to avoid the unwillingly forced termination and waste of limited bandwidth in the sectored cellular communications, particularly when the handoff traffic is heavy. In this paper, a self-adaptive bandwidth reservation scheme, which adopts support vector machines technique, is proposed to reduce the forced termination probability. Meanwhile, a channel-borrowing technique is used to decrease the new call-blocking probability of real-time traffic. The simulation results show that the proposed scheme can achieve superior performance than the representative bandwidth-reserving schemes in sectored cellular networks in the literature when performance metrics are measured in terms of the forced termination probability and the new call- blocking probability.",

    "abstract": "This paper describes the configuration of the total robot system and the component technologies, and explains the results from both a technical performance test and practical evaluation test. The goal of the project is to reduce the workload on nurses and care providers at mealtime by developing an autonomous mobile robot that carries food trays to the aged and disabled. After conducting practical evaluation tests in actual care facilities where difficult problems related to the surrounding conditions remain to be solved, it was demonstrated that introducing the use of robot to care facilities is realizable. For practical use, the robot should be further developed to enable highly efficient operation and to perform consecutive actions, comparable to human behavior. In addition, many kinds of user-interfaces for autonomous interaction with the aged should be provided for simple and quick recovery in any unforeseen event. Finally, production costs should be lowered. Planning is also going on to market the robot in the near future by improving its quality and performance based on the practical evaluation tests.",

    "abstract": "Display Omitted We propose a method for improving the quality of online health communities.We present a solution to reduce the workload of the online community moderators.We explore low-cost text classification methods to a new social media domain.We uncover social, ethical, and legal issues in creating a gold standard.We discuss using precision versus recall in supporting the community moderators. ObjectivesPatients increasingly visit online health communities to get help on managing health. The large scale of these online communities makes it impossible for the moderators to engage in all conversations; yet, some conversations need their expertise. Our work explores low-cost text classification methods to this new domain of determining whether a thread in an online health forum needs moderators' help. MethodsWe employed a binary classifier on WebMD's online diabetes community data. To train the classifier, we considered three feature types: (1) word unigram, (2) sentiment analysis features, and (3) thread length. We applied feature selection methods based on ?2 statistics and under sampling to account for unbalanced data. We then performed a qualitative error analysis to investigate the appropriateness of the gold standard. ResultsUsing sentiment analysis features, feature selection methods, and balanced training data increased the AUC value up to 0.75 and the F1-score up to 0.54 compared to the baseline of using word unigrams with no feature selection methods on unbalanced data (0.65 AUC and 0.40 F1-score). The error analysis uncovered additional reasons for why moderators respond to patients' posts. DiscussionWe showed how feature selection methods and balanced training data can improve the overall classification performance. We present implications of weighing precision versus recall for assisting moderators of online health communities. Our error analysis uncovered social, legal, and ethical issues around addressing community members' needs. We also note challenges in producing a gold standard, and discuss potential solutions for addressing these challenges. ConclusionSocial media environments provide popular venues in which patients gain health-related information. Our work contributes to understanding scalable solutions for providing moderators' expertise in these large-scale, social media environments.",

We demonstrated the benefits of staging in a user experiment with 20 lay subjects involved in a comparative visual search for targets, similar to a radiology task of identifying anatomical abnormalities. We designed a task and a set of stimuli that allowed us to simulate the interpretation workflow from a typical radiology scenario\u2014reading a chest radiography exam when a prior study is also available. The simulation was enabled by abstracting both the radiologist\u2019s task and the basic workstation navigation functionality. The staged interface was significantly faster than the traditional user interface, provided a 37% reduction in the interpretation errors, and improved user satisfaction.",

LTE system effectively utilizes the resources by dynamically scheduling the users in both frequency and time domain. However, scheduling algorithms are not defined in the Third Generation Partnership Project (3GPP) specifications. Therefore, it becomes one of the special interests for service providers. In this paper a study of downlink scheduling algorithms present in the literature is put forth and performance evaluation of four algorithms proposed for LTE downlink is carried out. This paper also discusses the key issues of scheduling algorithms to be considered for future traffic requirements",

By considering the relative distances of objects, some discretization approaches and other approaches were proposed in previous literature, to discuss the attribute reduces of the system. This paper considers ordinal relations of objects, and utilizes dominance relation rough set model to discuss decision rules acquisition problems. Firstly, concepts of order-based decision rules and generalized order-based decision rules are introduced. Then the concept of optimal order-based decision rule is defined. In order to compute optimal order-based decision rules, the concept of reduct of the object is proposed.

The feasibility of use of the superposition method in an LED array with multiple packages has been proved first by temperature comparisons with the simultaneous operation of an array (5i?5) of 25 high power LEDs mounted on a metal core printed circuit board (MCPCB). Compared with existing approaches, the superposition method will measure the internal temperature of chip directly, accurately and nondestructively. According to the relatively accurate and reliable self-heating and coupling temperature rise data, optimization scheme of LED lamp with multiple packages is proposed. The results show that increasing the heat source separation distance and improving the thermal conductivity of thermal interface materials will reduce the temperature rise and thermal non-uniformity.",

    "abstract": "In teaching online technical communication courses, shaping an electronic interface requires extensive consideration of the user experience, both for students and for faculty members who design and teach the courses. Technical communication faculty members should provide strong examples of effective user experiences and should be leaders in making the interfaces of online learning management systems as usable as possible.   Principles of usability designed for general web sites may or may not apply to learning management systems designed for educational purposes. In order to create effective online technical communication courses, one needs to consider both usability concerns and pedagogical concerns.   To assess the usability and pedagogical effectiveness of online courses, faculty members may use indirect means such as heuristic analyses. In addition, they may use direct means such as usability testing, student feedback, and analytic tools. Each approach has advantages as well as limitations. Faculty members will gain the richest information through using multiple approaches.   In assessing usability and pedagogical effectiveness, faculty members also need to consider the situational constraints and resources in their unique contexts. Understanding and adapting their approaches to use resources well and to work within constraints will benefit their abilities to enhance their student users' experiences with online courses.",

    "abstract": "In this paper we present X-Compass, an XML-based agent model for supporting a user in his Web activities. X-Compass is the result of our attempt of synthesizing, in a unique context, important guidelines currently characterizing the research in various Computer Science sectors. Indeed, it constructs and handles a rather rich, even if light, user profile; this latter is exploited for supporting the user in an efficient search of information of his interest; in this way, it behaves as a content-based Recommender System. Moreover, it is particularly suited for constructing multi-agent systems and, therefore, for implementing collaborative filtering recommendation techniques. In addition, since it widely uses XML technology, it is particularly light and capable of operating on various hardware and software platforms. The adoption of XML also facilitates the information exchange among X-Compass agents and, consequently, makes the management and the exploitation of X-Compass based multi-agent systems easier.",

    "abstract": "The ability of ATM Networks to support a wide range of applications has made it increasingly popular. As ATM Networks are more widely used, security services become a compelling requirement. Encryption in ATM Networks allows users to select an appropriate algorithm to implement security services for a given application. Algorithm-Agile-Encryptors (AAEs) implement multiple encryption algorithms in a single device. AAEs also reduce operational costs when they are shared among several users. However, algorithm agility may re-order cells belonging to different Virtual Circuits (VCs) and thereby affect the negotiated QoS. The two ways of scheduling the encrypted cells from the AAE are 'FIFO queuing' and 'Delay equalization'. This paper addresses the effect of the existing scheduling schemes on the QoS of ATM Networks. Further, a scheduling scheme called Partition Equalizer (PE) has been proposed and analyzed. It has been shown that the PE reduces both the Cell Transfer Delay and the Cell Delay Variation compared to the other existing schemes such as 'FIFO queuing' and 'Delay equalization'.",

    "abstract": "To interpret the information hidden in multidimensional data can be considered as challenging and complicated task. Usually, dimension reduction or data compression is considered as the first step to data analysis and exploration of multidimensional data. Here, the focus is given to study Auto-Associative Neural Networks (AANNs) technique for data compression and visualization. AANNs have the ability to deal with linear and nonlinear correlation among variables. This technique is often referred to as nonlinear Principal Component Analysis (NLPCA) or could also be known as Bottleneck Neural Networks (BNNs) due to their specific structures that consist of combination of compression and decompression networks. The trained AANNs can reduce high dimensional data onto lower dimensional data by compressing them on its bottleneck layer that later can be used for data visualization. In this paper, the technique of AANNs are described, developed using high level computer language and applied on two different multidimensional datasets. The results have shown that AANNs are able to compress multidimensional data into only two non linear principal components at its bottleneck layer and these compressed data can provide visualization of different clusters of data.",

    "abstract": "Air-traffic has grown rapidly in the last twenty years and concern has been mounting about the safety implications of mis-recognition of call-signs by both pilots and air-traffic controllers. This paper presents the results of a preliminary study into perceptual (i.e. non-cognitive) confusions in two closed vocabularies of the type used as aircraft call-signs. Conventional methods of subjective and objective testing were found to be unsuitable for our aim of predicting potential confusions within a vocabulary. Hence a method for modelling confusion probability in a closed vocabulary at a certain signal-to-noise ratio has been developed. The method is based on the use of a phoneme confusion matrix and a technique for comparing phoneme strings. The method is presented and results are given. These suggest that the behaviour of the model is plausible, and a comparison of its predictions with a set of real confusions showed a correct prediction of position of confusion in three-word phrases. The predictions of the model need to be verified by subjective testing before it can be deployed in a system that designs low-confusability call-signs, which is the ultimate goal of the research.",

    "abstract": "We report the results of extensive simulation work on a new satellite medium access control (MAC) protocol for medium quality interactive video. This MAC protocol uses combined random access/demand assigned multiple access (RA/DAMA). The underlying multiple access physical layer is time division multiple access (TDMA). The RA/DAMA MAC seeks to adaptively minimize the delay of each network layer (nl) packet that arrives to the output queue by transmitting packets on either a collision free demand assigned channel or on a collision possible random access channel. Combined with this dual channel transmission method is a new technique for acquiring demand assigned bandwidth, called a packet flow rate metric (PFRM). This metric seeks to track the slow time behavior of video traffic, leading to a significant reduction in the amount of DAMA signaling. All simulations were conducted using SMACS, the Satellite Medium Access Control Simulator [4], a simulation tool built into ns-2.0 (network simulator version 2) [10]. This simulation tool allowed us to evaluate our MAC protocol using an actual 2 hour long video trace rather than a parametric video traffic generator. Our results show that if light packet loss is tolerable (less than 3%), then significantly lower delays and higher link utilization can be achieved.",

    "abstract": "Millimeter wave (mmWave) systems must use beamforming to overcome the heavy attenuation at mmWave frequencies and establish high-quality communication links with reasonably high spectral efficiency. When received signal power is sufficiently large and the propagation channel is sufficiently rich, beamforming with multiple data streams, known as precoding, could further increase data rates in mmWave systems. The high cost of digital devices in mmWave systems, however, implies that precoding is predominantly done in the analog domain, making mmWave precoding significantly more constrained than traditional multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) solutions. In this paper, we propose an iterative precoding algorithm for a practical mmWave transmitter architecture in which all precoding is done in the analog domain. In addition to precoding, the proposed algorithm allows the mmWave system to adapt the rank of its transmission in response to varying propagation conditions. We present numerical results showing that the proposed multimode precoding algorithm allows systems to achieve large data rates, in some cases approaching channel capacity.",

    "abstract": "Distributed file system (DFS) is playing important roles of supporting large distributed data-intensive applications to meet storage needs. Typically, the design of DFS, such as GFS in Google, DMS in Cisco and TFS in Alibaba, is driven by observations of specific application workloads, internal demands and technological environment. In such systems, the metadata service is a critical factor that can affect the file system performance and availability to a great degree. Five requirements have been summarized for the metadata service: location transparent file service, smart director, efficient speed, strong scalability and friendly collaborator. In this paper, we present metadata service module called CH Masters in our DFS. Consistent hashing protocol is used to relieve potential hot spots on name servers. Files' metadata and master nodes are mapped into the same hash space by consistent hash function. And then files' metadata are scattered to master nodes by clockwise \"closest\" principle. Chunk server acts as a client when report its chunks info. Only a small proportion of files' metadata will be rehashed when master nodes state change. A new scalable file mapping strategy is also proposed to map file sizes from few MB to several GB efficiently. After intensive experiments, it shows CH Masters is satisfying the above five requirements.",

Nowadays, the prevalent parallel web browsing behavior caused by multi-tab web browsers renders accurate user click identification from massive requests a great challenge. In this paper, we propose a dependency graph model to describe the complicated web browsing behavior. Based on this model, we develop two algorithms to establish the dependency graph for measured requests, and identify user clicks by comparing their probabilities of being primary requests with a self-learned threshold. We evaluate our method with a large dataset collected from a real world mobile core network. The experimental results show that our method can achieve high accurate user clicks identification.",

However, even a single permanent fault, such as an interconnect fault, causes a deadlock state in the system. This paper presents an interconnect-fault-resilient delay-insensitive asynchronous communication link based on current-flow monitoring. Since current flow upon an interconnect is cut off by an open fault in the interconnect, the current is fed back to a transmitter, which increases a feedback current monotonically. Monitoring the feedback current makes it possible to detect the interconnect fault with delay insensitivity. The proposed link is evaluated by a 0.13\u03bcm CMOS technology with a Triple Modular Redundancy (TMR)-based asynchronous communication link which is resilient to the interconnect fault without the delay insensitivity. As a result, the energy consumption and the number of wires of the proposed link are reduced to 57% and 33%, respectively, in comparison with those of the conventional one.",

    "abstract": "Frequently, R-dimensional subspace-based methods are used to estimate the parameters in multidimensional harmonic retrieval problems in a variety of signal processing applications. Since the measured data is multi-dimensional, traditional approaches require stacking the dimensions into one highly structured matrix. Recently, we have proposed eigenvalue based multi-dimensional model order selection schemes, which exploit the multidimensional structure of the data in order to achieve a higher probability of correct detection. However, our proposed multi-dimensional schemes are restricted to white noise scenarios. In this paper, we show how the Higher Order Singular Value Decomposition (HOSVD) of the measurement tensor enables us to improve the model order estimation of the estimation error (ESTER) scheme in colored noise scenarios. By using the matrix based ESTER, only one set of eigenvectors is taken into account, while by using the R-dimensional ESTER we obtain R sets of n-mode eigenvectors of the measurement tensor that are jointly used to improve significantly the accuracy of the estimated model order.",

    "abstract": "We present GyroWand, a raycasting technique for 3D interactions in self-contained augmented reality (AR) head-mounted displays. Unlike traditional raycasting which requires absolute spatial and rotational tracking of a user's hand or controller to direct the ray, GyroWand relies on the relative rotation values captured by an inertial measurement unit (IMU) on a handheld controller. These values cannot be directly mapped to the ray direction due to the phenomenon of sensor drift and the mismatch between the orientations of the physical controller and the virtual content. To address these challenges GyroWand 1) interprets the relative rotational values using a state machine which includes an anchor, an active, an out-of-sight and a disambiguation state; 2) handles drift by resetting the default rotation when the user moves between the anchor and active states; 3) does not initiate raycasting from the user's hand, but rather from other spatial coordinates (e.g. chin, shoulder, or chest); and 4) provides three new disambiguation mechanisms: Lock&Twist, Lock&Drag, and AutoTwist. In a series of controlled user studies we evaluated the performance and convenience of different GyroWand design parameters. Results show that a ray originating from the user's chin facilitates selection. Results also show that Lock&Twist is faster and more accurate than other disambiguation mechanisms. We conclude with a summary of the lessons learned for the adoption of raycasting in mobile augmented reality head-mounted displays.",

However, our experience with TACITUS; especially in the MUC-3 evaluation, has shown that principled techniques for syntactic and pragmatic analysis can be bolstered with methods for achieving robustness. We describe three techniques for making syntactic analysis more robust-an agenda-based scheduling parser, a recovery technique for failed parses, and a new technique called terminal substring parsing. For pragmatics processing, we describe how the method of abductive inference is inherently robust, in that an interpretation is always possible, so that in the absence of the required world knowledge, performance degrades gracefully. Each of these techniques have been evaluated and the results of the evaluations are presented.",

    "abstract": "The power of linear and affine logic lies in their ability to model state change. However, in a trustless, peer-to-peer setting, it is difficult to force principals to commit to state changes. We show how to solve the peer-to-peer affine commitment problem using a generalization of Bitcoin in which transactions deal in types rather than numbers. This has applications to proof-carrying authorization and mechanically executable contracts. Importantly, our system can be---and is---implemented on top of the existing Bitcoin network, so there is no need to recruit computing power to a new protocol.",

By a simple linear deterioration function, we mean that the processing time of a job is a simple linear function of its execution start time. The objective is to find a sequence that minimizes total weighted completion time. Optimal schedules are obtained for some special cases. For the general case, several dominance properties and two lower bounds are derived to speed up the elimination process of a branch-and-bound algorithm. A heuristic algorithm is also proposed to overcome the inefficiency of the branch-and-bound algorithm.

With the growing use of mobile devices, it is important to develop approaches that support remote mobile verification. This paper outlines the need for a mobile/remote SVM-based authentication system that does not compromise the privacy of the subject being recognized. We discuss limitations of earlier privacy-preserving authentication systems and present necessary privacy and security requirements that make a system attractive from both the server's security point of view and from the client's privacy-centric point of view. We then present a novel protocol we call \u201cVaulted Verification\u201d that allows a server to remotely authenticate a client's biometric in a privacy preserving way.

The study is then extended to the case of non-ergodic settings, which enlights a substantial difference between the forward solution process (based on forward Kolmogorov equations) and the backward one. We shall clarify the role that backward solutions play in computing absorption probabilities and in the model-checking of stochastic logics as CSL and CSLTA, which typically require the steady state solution of a non-ergodic CTMC and MRP respectively. Moreover we show that the algorithm for the computation of the whole set of states that satisfy a CSL formula, which is standard practice in CSL model-checkers, can be seen as a case of computation of backward probabilities of Continuous Time Markov Chains (CTMCs). The backward computation of MRP is then inserted in the context of matrix-free solution technique, which allows to deal with MRP of much bigger size than the standard approach based on the computation and solution of the embedded Markov chain.",

    "abstract": "To help improve the performance of congestion avoidance protocols like Transmission Control Protocol (TCP) and to limit the impact of non-adaptive UDP-based applications, the Internet Engineering Task Force has recommended the widespread deployment of active queue management schemes. We describe in this paper a new Random Early Detection (RED) algorithm for congestion control called Dynamic-RED (DRED) from a gradient optimization perspective. One of the goals of RED schemes is to stabilize the queue lengths in routers. However, the current version of RED does not succeed in this goal because the equilibrium queue length strongly depends on the number of active TCP connections. Using a simple optimization technique, DRED randomly discards packets with a load-dependent probability when a buffer in a router gets congested. DRED is also able to stabilize a router queue occupancy at a level independent of the number of active connections over a wide range of load levels. This is done without estimating the number of active TCP connections or flows and without collecting or analyzing state information on individual flows.",

    "abstract": "Enterprise resource planning (ERP) systems are becoming mature technologies to support inter- and intra-company business processes even in small and medium enterprises. However, ERP systems are complex and expensive, and the decision to install an ERP system necessitates a choice of mechanisms for determining whether the ERP is needed, and once implemented, whether it is successful. User satisfaction is one evaluation mechanism for determining system success. This study looked at key-user satisfaction as a means of determining system success. Initial analyses of ERP system characteristics important for the environment were explored, and some previously validated user satisfaction instruments were selected for examination, using rigorous and systematic interview techniques and iterative development methods. A questionnaire was developed and then tested to prove its reliability and validity. Finally, a relationship was shown to exist between key-user satisfaction and perceived system success.",

In order to improve the performance of this semi-global technique, a new criterion to check depth discontinuity, is introduced.

Additionally, this work proposes the employment of a pixel dissimilarity metric for the computation of the cost term, which is then provided to the guided image filter approach to estimate the initial cost volume. The algorithm is tested on the four images of the online Middlebury stereo evaluation benchmark. Moreover, it is tested on 27 additional Middlebury stereo pairs for assessing thoroughly its performance. The extended comparison verifies the efficiency of this work.",

As a result, the data transmission rate of the MPPM-PSM scheme is better than those of the conventional MPPM scheme and the conventional PSM scheme.

    "abstract": "Abstract The concentration of air pollutants have in general been steadily increasing during the last three decades. To correctly gauge the impact of various sources of pollutants requires careful modelling of the complex physics processes associated with the chemistry and transport of air pollution. These models are computationally demanding and require today\u2019s fastest high performance computers for practical implementations. The damaging effects are normally due to the combined effects of several air pollutants. Therefore a reliable mathematical model must study simultaneously all relevant air pollu- tants. This requirement increases the size of the air pollution models. The discretization of models that contain many air pollutants leads to huge computational problems. After the discretization of such an air pollution model, systems of several hundred thousands (or even several millions) of equations arise and these have to be treated numerically during many time-steps (typically several thousands). Such big computational problems can successfully be treated only on big modern vector and/or parallel computers. However, access to a fast high-speed computer is not sufficient. One must also ensure that the great potential power of the computer is correctly exploited. Very often this is a rather difficult task. The efforts to solve this task in the case where the computer under consideration is a massively parallel machine will be discussed in this paper. Tests performed on several such computers will be presented.",

Furthermore, the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) gain penalty caused by the interference signals and the root mean square of the CSI were demonstrated. The numerical results presented in this paper demonstrate the system performance under very realistic propagation and detection conditions including MIMO system, CCI, imperfect CSI, generalized fading channels, and AWGN.

    "abstract": "The optimization of highway alignment requires a versatile set of cost functions and an efficient search method for achieving the best design. Because of numerous highway design considerations, this issue is classified as a constrained problem. The article describes how highway alignment optimization is a complex problem because of the infinite number of possible solutions for the problem and the continuous search space. In this study, a customized particle swarm optimization algorithm was used to search for a near-optimal highway alignment, which is a compound of several tangents that consist of circular (for horizontal design) and parabolic (for vertical alignment) curves. The selected highway alignment should meet the constraints of highway design while minimizing total cost as the objective function. The model uses geographical information system (GIS) maps as an efficient and fast way to calculate right-of-way costs, earthwork costs, and any other spatial information and constraints that should be implemented in the design process. The efficiency of the algorithm was verified through a case study using an artificial map as the study region. Finally, the authors applied the algorithm to a real-world example and the results were compared with the alignment found by traditional methods.",

We provide a graph partitioning formulation relevant to networking but different from extant graph partitioning literature. In particular, we require that the resultant partitions be connected, a constraint that changes the character of the problem significantly. We devise a solution that consists of distinct phases for initial partitioning, refinement and post-processing, propose efficient heuristics for each phase, and evaluate them extensively on internetwork-like graphs through simulation. The results suggest that vertex trading techniques, in vogue for a number of decades in graph partitioning, are highly applicable, but multilevel techniques favored by conventional graph partitioning research may be of limited value for internetwork-like graphs. This solution can be implemented in practical networks to automatically generate Internet OSPF areas or ATM PNNI clusters.",

The topology of the network is described by a directed graph. The proposed discontinuous interaction rule is capable of rejecting the effects of the disturbances and achieving consensus after a finite transient time. An upper bound to the convergence time is explicitly derived in the technical note.

    "abstract": "Group communication is extensively used in modern data centers. Multicast lends itself naturally to these communication patterns. Traditionally, concerns around reliability, scalability and security have resulted in poor adoption of IP multicast in the Internet. However, data center networks with their structured topologies and tighter control present an opportunity to address these concerns. Software defined networking (SDN) architectures, such as OpenFlow, further provide the opportunity to not merely adopt but also innovate multicast in data centers. In this paper, we present Avalanche - An SDN based system that enables multicast in commodity switches used in data centers. As part of Avalanche, we develop a new multicast routing algorithm called Avalanche Routing Algorithm (AvRA). AvRA attempts to minimize the size of the routing tree it creates for any given multicast group. In typical data center topologies like Tree and FatTree, AvRA reduces to an optimal routing algorithm that becomes a solution to the Steiner Tree problem. Avalanche leverages SDN to take advantage of the rich path diversity commonly available in data centers networks, and thereby achieves highly efficient bandwidth utilization. We implement Avalanche as an OpenFlow controller module. Our emulation of Avalanche with Mininet Hi-Fi shows that it improves application data rate by up to 12%, and lowers packet loss by 51%, on an average, compared to IP Multicast. We also build a simulator to evaluate Avalanche at scale. For the PortLand FatTree topology, Avalanche results in at least a 35% reduction, compared to IP Multicast, in the number of links that are less than 5% utilized, once the number of multicast groups exceeds 1000. Lastly, our results confirm that AvRA results in smaller trees compared to traditional IP Multicast routing.",

    "abstract": "In anonymous networks, a subset of nodes is chosen to act as covert relays to hide timing information from unauthorized observers. While such covert relays increase anonymity, they cause performance degradation by delaying or dropping packets. In this paper, we propose flow allocation methods that maximize anonymity for multipath wireless networks with predetermined covert relay nodes, while taking into account packet-loss as a constraint. Using a rate-distortion framework, we show how to assign probabilities which split the flows from source to destination among all possible routes and show that selecting routes according to the assigned probabilities achieves maximum anonymity given the packet-loss constraint.",

In this way, both CPG knowledge representation and execution semantics are maintained within the same formalism. We have developed three different OWL-based CPG execution engines using OWL-DL, OWL 2 and SWRL. We evaluate the efficacy of our execution engines by executing an existing OWL based CPG.

Therefore, in this article we explain the architectural and technical challenges for D2D communication in the 3GPP standard, and at the end of the article we also highlight the real-life applications and use cases for D2D communication.

    "abstract": "In ancient times, people exchanged their goods and services to obtain what they needed (such as clothes and tools) from other people. This system of bartering compensated for the lack of currency. People offered goods/services and received in kind other goods/services. Now, despite the existence of multiple currencies and the progress of humanity from the Stone Age to the Byte Age, people still barter but in a different way. Mainly, people use money to pay for the goods they purchase and the services they obtain. Commerce Notwithstanding the technologies that are involved, undertaking commerce can be associated with one of the four types of exchange: bargaining, bidding, auctioning, and clearing [3]. The first two types of exchange are bilateral and the last two types of exchange are trilateral (that is, a third party intervenes). \u2022 Bargaining involves one user that negotiates with a provider until an agreement between both is reached. First, the user looks for a provider, browses their products, and then negotiates with the provider for an agreement. If the negotiation fails, the user continues searching for other providers until an agreement with one of them is reached. \u2022 Bidding involves one user and several providers. First, the user calls for bids. Next, the user compares the offers that providers have submitted after receiving the call for bids. Finally, the user selects the provider that has made the lowest offer (that is, the offer that minimizes the user\u2019s expense). \u2022 Auctioning (English scenario) involves one provider, several potential users, and one broker. First, the provider fixes the lowest price of the product. Through the broker, the provider advertises their products and calls for auctions. Next, the different users respond to the call for auctions by making offers to the broker.

    "abstract": "The success of several constraint-based modeling languages such as OPL, ZINC or COMET, appeals for better software engineering practices, particularly in the testing phase. This paper introduces a testing framework enabling automated test case generation for constraint programming. We propose a general framework of constraint program development which supposes that a first declarative and simple constraint model is available from the problem specifications analysis. Then, this model is refined using classical techniques such as constraint reformulation, surrogate, redundant, implied, global constraint and symmetry-breaking to form an improved constraint model that must be thoroughly tested before being used to address real-sized problems. We think that most of the faults are introduced in this refinement step and propose a process which takes the first declarative model as an oracle for detecting non-conformities and derive practical test purposes from this process. We implemented this approach in a new tool called CPTEST that was used to automatically detect non-conformities on classical benchmark programs, such as the Golomb rulers, n-queens, social golfer and the car-sequencing problems.",

    "abstract": "Objective : Movements made by healthy individuals can be characterized as superpositions of smooth bell-shaped velocity curves. Decomposing complex movements into these simpler \u201csubmovement\u201d building blocks is useful for studying the neural control of movement as well as measuring motor impairment due to neurological injury.  Approach : One prevalent strategy to submovement decomposition is to formulate it as an optimization problem. This optimization problem is nonconvex and finding an exact solution is computationally burdensome. We build on previous literature that generated approximate solutions to the submovement optimization problem.  Results : First, we demonstrate broad conditions on the submovement building block functions that enable the optimization variables to be partitioned into disjoint subsets, allowing for a faster alternating minimization solution. Specifically, the amplitude parameters of a submovement can typically be fit independently of its shape parameters. Second, we develop a method to concentrate the search in regions of high error to make more efficient use of optimization routine iterations.  Conclusion : Both innovations result in substantial reductions in computation time across multiple nonhuman primate subjects and diverse task conditions.   Significance : These innovations may accelerate analysis of submovements for basic neuroscience and enable real-time applications of submovement decomposition.",

    "abstract": "A Wireless Sensor Network (WSN) is made up of a mass of nodes with the character of self-organizing, multi-hop and limited resources. The normal operation of the network calls for cooperation among the nodes. However, there are some nodes that may choose selfish behavior when considering their limited resources such as energy, storage space and so on. The whole network will be paralyzed and unable to provide the normal service if most of the nodes do not forward data packages and take selfish actions in the network. In this paper, we adopt a dynamic incentive mechanism which suits wireless sensor networks based on the evolutionary game. The mechanism emphasizes the nodes adjust strategies forwardly and passively to maximize the fitness, making the population in the wireless sensor network converge to a cooperative state ultimately and promoting the selfish nodes cooperating with each other such that the network could offer normal service.

To make it easier to network manager's awareness, a DoS attack situation visualization method based on Parallel Coordinates is proposed. In this method, node resource consumption is represented as the values of axes. Resource usages for each node express by a fold line. The overall impact and node resource consumption details of DoS attacks can effectively demonstrate. In addition, interactive K-Means algorithm is used to cluster nodes and color different classifications into different colors. Experimental result shows that the clustering performance is improved without increasing the burden on the system, and the visualization is enhanced.",

    "abstract": "Parent-centric real-parameter crossover operators create the offspring in the neighbourhood of one of the parents, the female parent. The other parent, the male one, defines the range of the neighbourhood. With the aim of improving the behaviour of these crossover operators, we present three processes that are performed before their application. First, a female and male differentiation process determines the individuals in the population that may become female or/and male parents. Then, two different selection mechanisms choose the female and male parents from each group. In addition, we tackle the election of the most adequate evolution model to take out profit from these parent selection mechanisms. The experimental results confirm that these three processes may enhance the operation of the parent-centric crossover operators.",

In this paper, we applied feature-based clustering and classification method to the research of AIV cross-species infection, finding useful patterns, and created a web-based early warning system. We also applied entropy plot and regression analysis to discover host-associated sites in AIV cross-species infection, and got the key sites that differentiate human versus avian influenza using the same method. Compared the two sets, we expected to discover some rules about the mutation trend.",

Higher velocities produce larger U's but increase pressure drops. Design involves trade-offs among tube diameter, tube length and number of tubes to achieve a specified pressure drop and per-pass conversion.#R##N##R##N#This paper points out that another design optimization variable is available to improve the dynamic stability of cooled tubular reactors. If the catalyst activity is high, the size of the required reactor is small, which implies small heat-transfer area, and the reactor can be uncontrollable. If the catalyst is diluted with an inert solid, a bigger reactor will be required that will have more heat-transfer area and provide improved dynamic stability. This catalyst dilution strategy is explored for two reaction systems: a hypothetical chemical process and the carbonylation of dimethyl ether to produce methyl acetate.",

    "abstract": "Despite the advantages of the traditional vector space model (VSM) representation, there are known deficiencies concerning the term independence assumption. The high dimensionality and sparsity of the text feature space and phenomena such as polysemy and synonymy can only be handled if a way is provided to measure term similarity. Many approaches have been proposed that map document vectors onto a new feature space where learning algorithms can achieve better solutions. This paper presents the global term context vector-VSM (GTCV-VSM) method for text document representation. It is an extension to VSM that: (i) it captures local contextual information for each term occurrence in the term sequences of documents; (ii) the local contexts for the occurrences of a term are combined to define the global context of that term; (iii) using the global context of all terms a proper semantic matrix is constructed; (iv) this matrix is further used to linearly map traditional VSM (Bag of Words\u2014BOW) document vectors onto a \u2018semantically smoothed\u2019 feature space where problems such as text document clustering can be solved more efficiently. We present an experimental study demonstrating the improvement of clustering results when the proposed GTCV-VSM representation is used compared with traditional VSM-based approaches.",

This paper summarizes a project that aims to instill these skills as part of an entrepreneurial mindset in engineering students. The project was implemented in an introductory electric circuits class with a mixed representation of students majoring in electrical, computer, civil, and mechanical engineering. Students were organized into groups of two or three to design a temperature sensor using a negative temperature coefficient thermistor. Students groups were provided with customer specifications and were given a month to research the problem and obtain a viable solution. The groups were required to provide evidence compiled into a written product proposal that included a bill of materials, cost analysis, circuit design and simulation, testing plan, layout of the printed circuit board and packaging schematic, delivery time, and the voltage-temperature relationship of the designed circuit. After submitting the written proposal, each group was given five minutes to pitch their proposal using a poster in an effort to convince the customer (in this case, the instructor) that their design was the best and most cost-effective solution.",

    "abstract": "We propose a novel approach to generating synthetic training data.We introduce detector-specific similarity measures between real and synthetic images.We show that the choice of the similarity measure relies on the features used by the detector.We have tested our approach on different object detection tasks. We propose a novel approach to synthesizing images that are effective for training object detectors. Starting from a small set of real images, our algorithm estimates the rendering parameters required to synthesize similar images given a coarse 3D model of the target object. These parameters can then be reused to generate an unlimited number of training images of the object of interest in arbitrary 3D poses, which can then be used to increase classification performances. A key insight of our approach is that the synthetically generated images should be similar to real images, not in terms of image quality, but rather in terms of features used during the detector training. We show in the context of drone, plane, and car detection that using such synthetically generated images yields significantly better performances than simply perturbing real images or even synthesizing images in such way that they look very realistic, as is often done when only limited amounts of training data are available.",

    "abstract": "Biped robots are expected to keep stability after experiencing unknown disturbances which often exist in human daily environments. This paper presents a novel method to reject omnidirectional disturbances by optimizing the accelerations of the floating base of the robot. The optimized accelerations keep the desired external forces within their constraints and generate coordinated whole-body motion to reject disturbances from all directions. The effectiveness of the proposed method is confirmed by simulations with disturbance-rejection scenarios.",

    "abstract": "Moving to smaller libraries can be considered as a relevant task when porting software systems to limited-resource devices (e.g., hand-helds). Library miniaturization will be particularly effective if based on both dynamic (keeping into account dependencies exploited during application execution in a given user profile) and static (keeping into account all possible dependencies) information. This paper presents distributed software architecture, based on Web services, to collect dynamic information at run-time, and an approach for miniaturization of libraries, exploiting both dynamic and static information with the aim of reducing the memory requirements of executables. New, smaller libraries are identified via hierarchical clustering and genetic algorithms; clustering produces a first initial solution, then optimized by multi-objective genetic algorithms. The approach has been applied to medium size open source software systems such as Samba and MySQL, allowing to effectively produce smaller, loosely coupled libraries, and to reduce the memory requirements of each application.",

    "abstract": "The usage of descriptive data mining methods for predictive purposes is a recent trend in data mining research. It is well motivated by the understandability of learned models, the limitation of the so-called \"horizon effect\" and by the fact that it is a multi-task solution. In particular, associative classification, whose main idea is to exploit association rules discovery approaches in classification, gathered a lot of attention in recent years. A similar idea is represented by the use of emerging patterns discovery for classification purposes. Emerging Patterns are classes of regularities whose support significantly changes from one class to another and the main idea is to exploit class characterization provided by discovered emerging patterns for class labeling. In this paper we propose and compare two distinct emerging patterns based classification approaches that work in the relational setting. Experiments empirically prove the effectiveness of both approaches and confirm the advantage with respect to associative classification.",

    "abstract": "In low-duty-cycle wireless sensor networks, wireless nodes usually have two states: active state and dormant state. The necessary condition for a successful wireless transmission is that both the sender and the receiver are awake. In this paper, we study the problem: How fast can raw data be collected from all source nodes to a sink in low-duty-cycle WSNs with general topology? Both the lower and upper tight bounds are given for this problem. We use TDMA scheduling on the same frequency channel and present centralized and distributed fast data collection algorithms to find an optimal solution in polynomial time when no interfering links happen. If interfering links happen, multichannel scheduling is introduced to eliminate them. We next propose a novel Receiver-based Channel and Time Scheduling (RCTS) algorithm to obtain the optimal solution. Based on real trace, extensive simulations are conducted and the results show that the proposed RCTS algorithm is significantly more efficient than the link schedule on one channel and achieves the lower bound. We also evaluate the proposed data collection algorithms and find that RCTS is time-efficient and suffices to eliminate most of the interference in both indoor and outdoor environment for moderate size networks.",

    "abstract": "A spatio-temporal frequency response analysis is developed based on the multi-dimensional Fourier transform, which decomposes spatio-temporal input and output signals into travelling waves of different spatial wavenumbers and temporal frequencies. A spatio-temporal pulse test is also developed to allow for simultaneous input of multiple wavenumber\u2013frequency combinations. This analysis is applied to a membrane channel, where the input is an effective streamwise fluid velocity at the wall that varies along the membrane length and in time. The combined effect of the temporal frequencies and spatial wavenumbers of the slip velocity on the resulting solute concentration oscillations, which have the potential for reducing the susceptibility of the membrane to fouling, is analysed at Reynolds numbers of 280 and 560, and Schmidt numbers of 600 and 1200. Frequencies up to 800\u00a0Hz and wavenumbers up to 500\u00a0m\u22121 are studied. It is found that for each wavenumber there is a corresponding temporal frequency that results in a maximum amplitude ratio. Developing a spatio-temporal frequency response profile for such a system helps the design of control input profiles that decrease fouling in membrane systems.",

The demand for the reliable verification of a passenger's identity is based on efficiency and security aspects of ABC systems which have to be taken into account. Face recognition technologies allow for an automation of the traditional manual inspection by a border guard. This paper presents an evaluation of the face verification performance of commercial face recognition technologies based on operational data from an existing eGate at an airport. In addition to comparisons of the overall performance, more detailed considerations such as the influence of the remaining validity of the passport are made. Moreover, the performance implications of the nationality of the passports, which may be the result of the different quality of the passport photos or increased cooperativeness of the passengers based on previous experiences with eGates, are considered as well.",

The general motivation is that the subspace parameters can be estimated on multiple source languages and then transferred to the target language. In this work, we investigate an extension to SGMM, referred to as subspace mixture model (SMM), in which subspace parameters on the target language are casted as a linear mixture of the subspaces derived from source languages. This approach reduces the number of SGMM model parameters, while retaining the flexibility of subspace learning on the target language. Experiments show that the proposed SMM method outperforms SGMM significantly when the target language has limited training data.",

Stemmers have been used to more accurately determine relevance between a keyword query and methods in source code for search, exploration, and bug localization. In this paper, we investigate which traditional stemmers perform best on the domain of software, specifically, Java source code. We compare the stemmers using two case studies: a comparative analysis of the unified word classes in terms of accuracy and completeness, as well as an investigation into the effectiveness of stemming for software search. Our results indicate that relative stemmer effectiveness varies with a software engineering tool such as search, justifying further research into this area.",

    "abstract": "Based on speculations coming from statistical mechanics and the conjectured existence of critical states, I propose a simple heuristic in order to control the mutation probability and the population size of a genetic algorithm. Genetic algorithms are widely used nowadays, as well as their cousins evolutionary algorithms. The most cited initial references on genetic algorithms are the beautiful books of Holland [10], who tried to initiate a theoretical analysis of these processes, and of Goldberg [9], who made a very attractive exposition of these algorithms. The literature on genetic algorithms is now so huge that it is beyond my ability to compile a decent reasonable review. For years, there has been an urgent and growing demand for guidelines to operate a genetic algorithm on a practical problem. On the theoretical side, progress is quite slow and somehow disappointing for practitioners. The theoretical works often deal with a simple toy problem, otherwise the behavior of the genetic algorithm is too complex to be amenable to rigorous mathematical analysis. Here I propose a simple heuristic in order to control efficiently the genetic algorithm, based on speculations coming from statistical mechanics and the conjectured existence of critical states. Although it is quite simple, I have not been able to locate this heuristic in the literature, and I hope it will be useful. Apart from my own belief, it is supported by several empirical studies, the most notable one being the work of Ochoa [13], and it is in accordance with several conclusions and ideas appearing in the work of van Nimwegen and Crutchfield [17]. Error threshold. The fundamental notion on which the heuristic is based is the notion of error threshold, introduced by Manfred Eigen in 1971 [6].

This is due to the compactness of the representations, which are turning this paradigm into a common way of dealing with highly redundant computations occurring, for instance, in natural language processing, logic programming or abstract interpretation and related to phenomena such as non determinism or domain ordering. However, it is not usual to find practical studies about what the real interest of these techniques is, and which approaches are better adapted in each case. We justify the consideration of dynamic programming, both in definite clause and context free grammar parsing, highlighting the parallelism between the conclusions reached in both cases. We focus on the computational properties, suggesting a simple decision guide for the reader interested in applying this technology.",

In comparison with other recent block ciphers, the implementation results of ICEBERG show a significant improvement of hardware efficiency. Moreover, the key and E/D agility allows considering new encryption modes to counteract certain side-channel attacks.",

    "abstract": "We experimentally study the effects of two variables in task sequence design, price and difficulty of tasks, on the quality of work produced in a task sequence. We find that in a three-task sequence, the work quality of a task is influenced by prices of all previous tasks, potentially at various degrees. For the effects of task difficulty, however, we observe similar work quality of a task regardless whether the task follows an easier or more difficult task. This observation is inconsistent with the prediction of either the task switching effect or the sequential difficulty effect in the literature. Interestingly, according to a post-task survey, workers seem to adjust their perception of appropriate payment for a task according to the change of difficulty levels over tasks  in a sequence, suggesting a potential \"anchoring\" effect on task difficulty. The insensitivity of work quality to the change of task difficulty levels is possibly a result of a mixture of different effects.",

    "abstract": "All existing contrast enhancement methods focus on heightening of spatial details in the luminance channel, with no or little consideration of the color fidelity of the processed images; they can introduce highly noticeable distortions in hue and saturation. This long-time much overlooked problem is addressed by this paper. A new algorithm based on Wu's optimal contrast-tone mapping (OCTM) is proposed to make maximal gain of contrast while keeping the hue component the same and at the same time respecting an upper bound on the distortion of saturation. Experimental results demonstrate the superior perceptual quality of the new chromaticity-conserving contrast enhancement algorithm over existing methods.",

    "abstract": "In this paper, we propose a generalized method to represent multilateral teleoperation system as an electrical network with dependent effort/flow sources which allows us to implement Time Domain Passivity Approach (TDPA) to passivate the system. Using the conventional mechanical-electrical analogy, the multilateral teleoperation system with mechanical nature is modelled as an electrical circuit. Power correlated signal are then identified to extract the augmented network representation in which time-delay is taken into account. The passivity of multilateral teleoperation system are also analyzed and the method of using TDPA to passivate the network is proposed. This framework is independent of control architecture and communication delay. Experiment on a trilateral teleoperation system has been done and showed good performance with proposed method.",

    "abstract": "Aspect-oriented programing (AOP) improves the separation of concerns by encapsulating crosscutting concerns into aspects. Thus, aspect-oriented programing aims to better support the evolution of systems. Along this line, we have defined a process that assists the developer to refactor an object-oriented system into an aspect-oriented one. In this paper we propose the use of association rules and Markov models to improve the assistance in accomplishing some of the tasks of this process. Specifically, we use these techniques to help the developer in the task of encapsulating a fragment of aspectizable code into an aspect. This includes the choice of a fragment of aspectizable code to be encapsulated, the selection of a suitable aspect refactoring, and the analysis and application of additional restructurings when necessary. Our case study of the refactoring of a J2EE system shows that the use of the process reduces the intervention of the developer during the refactoring.",

    "abstract": "Can a dynamical system paint masterpieces such as Da Vinci's Mona Lisa or Monet's Water Lilies? Moreover, can this dynamical system be chaotic in the sense that although the trajectories are sensitive to initial conditions, the same painting is created every time? Setting aside the creative aspect of painting a picture, in this work, we develop a novel algorithm to reproduce paintings and photographs. Combining ideas from ergodic theory and control theory, we construct a chaotic dynamical system with predetermined statistical properties. If one makes the spatial distribution of colors in the picture the target distribution, akin to a human, the algorithm first captures large scale features and then goes on to refine small scale features. Beyond reproducing paintings, this approach is expected to have a wide variety of applications such as uncertainty quantification, sampling for efficient inference in scalable machine learning for big data, and developing effective strategies for search and rescue. In particular, our preliminary studies demonstrate that this algorithm provides significant acceleration and higher accuracy than competing methods for Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC).",

The results and techniques presented here are not new; rather, we use these problems to introduce and demonstrate several of the key ideas and tools of algebraic geometry. The problems we discuss are the following: Given p points, / lines, and c conies in the plane, how many conies are there that contain the given points, are tangent to the given lines, and are tangent to the given conies? It is not even clear a priori that these questions are well-posed. The answers may depend on which points, lines, and conies we are given. Nineteenth and twentieth century geometers struggled to make sense of these questions, to show that with the proper interpretation they admit clean answers, and to put the subject of enumerative algebraic geometry on a firm mathematical foundation. Indeed, Hilbert made this endeavor the subject of his fifteenth challenge problem.",

This paper reports preliminary findings from an online survey with parents about children's use of voice input systems and a content analysis of YouTube videos depicting child interaction with one popular voice input system. Our results reveal three primary ways in which children use voice input systems:  exploration , to understand and relate to the voice agent and for fun;  information seeking , related to fact-finding questions and information about their surrounding environment; and  functional , as a means of operating the device. While our results are preliminary, they highlight a variety of opportunities and challenges voice input systems present for children and parents.",

For example, automobile assembly processes utilizing power-assist systems exist. Many power-assist systems for industrial uses possess simple power-assisting functions only. The transfer of controlled objects is generally processed by another system. This paper proposes a transfer control method for a cart with motor by means of a smooth switching from the impedance control realizing the power-assist to the servo control for automatic transfer. To obtain the smooth switching, this paper utilizes a nonstationary impedance control method whose impedance parameters are time varying. A linear quadratic integral control method based on time-varying feedback gains is also introduced. By considering the setting of the time-varying parameters, the control characteristic is smoothly varied without control input saturation. This method increases the efficiency of control processes and realizes comfortable work for operators. The effectiveness of the method is verified by experiments and simulations",

Problems of this class would be easy to solve if the side-constraints were not present, and so the technique of Lagrangian relaxation is often applied as part of the solution strategy. A Lagrangian relaxation of a problem provides a lower bound (for a minimization problem) on the optimal value of the objective function of the original problem. The objective of this paper is the exploration of the relationship between Lagrangian relaxation and parametric programming, and the presentation of a procedure that is based on parametric programming for solving the Lagrangian relaxation problem. This procedure may also be integrated with the popular subgradient method in order to provide an efficient and effective solution strategy for the Lagrangian relaxation problem.",

This approach is motivated by the fact that the optimal state estimator is based on a forward-in-time Riccati-based solution that does not require advance knowledge of the system dynamics. In this paper we show that a forward-in-time Riccati-based control law stabilizes the system if the dynamics of the quasi-dual system are asymptotically stable. This property holds if the closed-loop dynamics are symmetric, and, for some plants, is achieved by dynamics with sufficiently fast time variation. In addition, using a separation principal type result, we guarantee closed-loop stability in the case of output feedback.",

    "abstract": "Equilibrium logic, introduced by David Pearce, extends the concept of an answer set from logic programs to arbitrary sets of formulas. Logic programs correspond to the special case in which every formula is a \u201crule\u201d \u2014 an implication that has no implications in the antecedent (body) and consequent (head). The semantics of equilibrium logic looks very different from the usual definitions of an answer set in logic programming, as it is based on Kripke models. In this paper we propose a new definition of equilibrium logic which uses the concept of a reduct, as in the standard definition of an answer set. Second, we apply the generalized concept of an answer set to the problem of defining the semantics of aggregates in answer set programming. We propose, in particular, a semantics for weight constraints that covers the problematic case of negative weights. Our semantics of aggregates is an extension of the approach due to Faber, Leone, and Pfeifer to a language with choice rules and, more generally, arbitrary rules with nested expressions.",

A first-person shooter game was experimentally manipulated to create either a low level or a high level of suspense.

We consider the encoding and decoding procedures of both ordinary concatenated codes, and generalized concatenated codes where block codes are used as inner codes. We give the main parameters of these codes, and by means of examples, show that under the same conditions the latter outperforms the former with respect to minimum code distance. We also heuristically describe the generalized concatenated decoding procedure. Then we show how the generalized concatenated coding ideas can be applied to encoded memoryless modulation. Such construction is often referred to as a multilevel code in literature. We consider the multilevel codes from the standpoint of generalized concatenated codes and with the help of a simple example, show how encoding and decoding procedures can be carried out. Ordinary concatenated and generalized concatenated coding schemes are considered next, using inner convolutional codes or inner modulation with memory. With the help of examples, we analyze the distance properties of such constructions.",

For the discrete frequency spectrum with high frequency band being zeros, this paper proposes a fast implementation method of inverse fast Fourier transform to reduce the computational cost.

Compared to the widely studied MPEG-4 encoded video, the recently adopted H.264 video coding standards include novel mechanisms, such as hierarchical B frame prediction structures and highly efficient quality scalable coding, that have important implications for network transport. This tutorial introduces a trace-based evaluation methodology for the network transport of H.264 encoded video. We first give an overview of H.264 video coding, and then present the trace structures for capturing the characteristics of H.264 encoded video. We give an overview of the typical video traffic and quality characteristics of H.264 encoded video. Finally, we explain how to account for the H.264 specific coding mechanisms, such as hierarchical B frames, in networking studies.",

    "abstract": "Effective systems for teaching languages like English has always been in demand, and is an active area of research. This paper discusses a system for tutoring the grammatical voice conversion aimed at students in the age group of 12 to 16 years. One major concern in such systems is in generating adequate range of sentences for teaching and evaluation. We use a sentence generation mechanism, based on a template structure, for this purpose. Use of template structure helps in generation of a large number of meaningful and grammatically correct sentences. Another concern is to assess the student response correctly, to identify the error and provide proper feedback. Our system addresses this through a carefully designed set of knowledge bases. Currently the system can handle the conversion for simple sentences in almost all common tenses, this is being extended to handle more complex sentences. A pilot study has been conducted to test the utility of the system, and the results are very positive.",

    "abstract": "Document analysis and graphics recognition algorithms are normally applied to the processing of images of 2D documents scanned when flattened against a planar surface. Technological advancements in recent years have led to a situation in which digital cameras with high resolution are widely available. Consequently, traditional graphics recognition tasks may be updated to accommodate document images captured through a camera in an uncontrolled environment. In this paper the problem of document image rectification is discussed. The rectification targets the correction of perspective and geometric distortions of document images taken from uncalibrated cameras, by synthesizing new views which are better suited for existing graphics recognition and document analysis techniques. The proposed approach targets cases in which the document is not necessarily flat, without relaying on specific modeling assumptions, and by utilizing one or more overlapping views of the document. Document image rectification results are provided for several cases.",

    "abstract": "Data compression has been suggested as a nonparametric way of discriminating between message sources. Compressions obtained from a Lempel-Ziv algorithm for relatively short messages, such as those encountered in practice, are examined. The intuitive notion of message complexity has less connection with compression than one might expect from known asymptotic results about infinite messages. Nevertheless, discrimination by compression remains an interesting possibility. >",

    "abstract": "We improve the overall rate-distortion performance of distributed video coding by efficient techniques of correlation noise estimation and key frame encoding. In existing transform-domain Wyner-Ziv video coding methods, blocks within a frame are treated uniformly to estimate the correlation noise even though the success of generating side information is different for each block. We propose a method to estimate the correlation noise by differentiating blocks within a frame based on the accuracy of the side information. Simulation results show up to 2 dB improvement over conventional methods without increasing encoder complexity. Also, in traditional Wyner-Ziv video coding, the intercorrelation of key frames is not exploited since they are simply intracoded. In this paper, we propose a frequency band coding mode selection for key frames to exploit similarities between adjacent key frames at the decoder. Simulation results show significant improvement especially for low-motion and high frame rate sequences. Furthermore, the advantage of applying both schemes in a hierarchical order is investigated. This method achieves additional improvement.",

    "abstract": "With the rapid advances in wireless network communication, multimedia presentation has become more applicable. However, due to the limited wireless network resource and the mobility of Mobile Host (MH), QoS for wireless streaming is much more difficult to maintain. How to decrease Call Dropping Probability (CDP) in multimedia traffic while still keeping acceptable Call Block Probability (CBP) without sacrificing QoS has become an significant issue in providing wireless streaming services. In this paper, we propose a novel Dynamic Resources Adjustment (DRA) algorithm, which can dynamically borrow idle reserved resources in the serving cell or the target cell for handoffing MHs to compensate the shortage of bandwidth in media streaming. The experimental simulation results show that compared with traditional No Reservation (NR), and Resource Reservation in the six neighboring cells (RR-nb), and Resource Reservation in the target cell (RR-t), our proposed DRA algorithm can fully utilize unused reserved resources to effectively decrease the CDP while still keeping acceptable CBP with high bandwidth utilization.",

In order to estimate the algebraic variables directly, an improved algorithm is developed to reconstruct the algebraic variables that are subject to a singular distribution matrix of algebraic variables, using a series of elementary matrices followed by differentiation. An SMO is then designed based on the reconstructed algebraic variables in order to compensate for the effect of disturbances on estimation error dynamics such that the estimated states, including both the differential and algebraic variables, can follow the actual ones. The stability of the proposed observer is proven and an illustrative example is given to demonstrate the effectiveness of the improved algorithm for constructing the SMO.",

    "abstract": "Many simple one-dimensional discrete models, for example, the Ricker and the logistic model, exhibit chaotic behaviour for large values of the map parameter r. However, if a bounded stochastic perturbation with a positive expectation is introduced, for r large, the map has a blurred asymptotically stable two-cycle, under some restrictions on the perturbation bounds and their mean. The paper considers two general types of maps including the Ricker and the truncated logistic model. It is demonstrated that bistability and multistability are possible, however, when perturbations are independent and identically distributed random variables and r is large enough, trajectories eventually go into the blurred two-cycle with probability one. Moreover, with probability close to 1, there is a number starting from which all the trajectories are in the blurred two-cycle.",

    "abstract": "In this paper, we introduce a variant of the density peaks clustering (DPC) approach for discovering demand hot spots from a low-frequency, low-quality taxi fleet operational dataset. From the literature, the DPC approach mainly uses density peaks as features to discover potential cluster centers, and this requires distances between all pairs of data points to be calculated. This implies that the DPC approach can only be applied to cases with relatively small numbers of data points. For the domain of urban taxi operations that we are interested in, we could have millions of demand points per day, and calculating all-pair distances between all demand points would be practically impossible, thus making DPC approach not applicable. To address this issue, we project all points to a density image and execute our variant of the DPC algorithm on the processed image. Experiment results show that our proposed DPC variant could get similar results as original DPC, yet with much shorter execution time and lower memory consumption. By running our DPC variant on a real-world dataset collected in Singapore, we show that there are indeed recurrent demand hot spots within the central business district that are not covered by the current taxi stand design. Our approach could be of use to both taxi fleet operator and traffic planners in guiding drivers and setting up taxi stands.",

    "abstract": "An NP-hardness proof for non-local Multicomponent Tree Adjoining Grammar (MCTAG) by Rambow and Satta (1st International Workshop on Tree Adjoining Grammers 1992), based on Dahlhaus and Warmuth (in J Comput Syst Sci 33:456---472, 1986), is extended to some linguistically relevant restrictions of that formalism. It is found that there are NP-hard grammars among non-local MCTAGs even if any or all of the following restrictions are imposed: (i) lexicalization: every tree in the grammar contains a terminal; (ii) dominance links: every tree set contains at most two trees, and in every such tree set, there is a link between the foot node of one tree and the root node of the other tree, indicating that the former node must dominate the latter in the derived tree. This is the version of MCTAG proposed in Becker et al. (Proceedings of the 5th conference of the European chapter of the Association for Computational Linguistics 1991) to account for German long-distance scrambling. This result restricts the field of possible candidates for an extension of Tree Adjoining Grammar that would be both mildly context-sensitive and linguistically adequate.",

    "abstract": "Abstract   This paper presents an interesting extension of the combinatorial filing scheme approach to information retrieval. It is appropriate both in the traditional large secondary memory architecture for information retrieval and in the distributed computing paradigm of powerful but cheaper, smaller machines. An important characteristic of the proposed scheme, unlike other combinatorial ones, is that redundancy can be decreased by varying a parameter. Moreover, the construction process is significantly simpler, the number of buckets smaller and the choice of parameters greater than for the typical combinatorial schemes, all of which make this scheme an attractive information retrieval approach for today's technology.  In particular, families of balanced multiple-valued filing schemes of order  k  over the projective geometry PG( t ,  q ) are constructed. Certain ( s  +  c )-flats formed from the union of distinct flats of a partial spread of order ( s  + 1), such that   c \u00a6(t \u2212 s)   and which pass through the  s -flat  V   s  , are used to define the attributes and values. For order  k  queries, the buckets are the ( k  +  h )-flats through a fixed  h -flat,  V   h  , of PG( t ,  q ),   V     h   C  V     s   . Storage and retrieval algorithms use difference set representation, and structural properties, of the bucket flats. The number of attributes and number of values per attribute are dependent on the values of  s  and  c . The redundancy is made to vary with the value of  h . A particular scheme of order  k  in the family is a balanced multiple-valued filing scheme, BMFS  k  , with parameters ( s ,  c ,  h ).",

    "abstract": "In a distributed computing system, a number of program modules may need to be allocated to different processors such that the reliability of executing successfully these modules is maximized and the constraints with limited resources are satisfied. The problem of finding an optimal task allocation with maximum system reliability has been shown to be NP-hard; thus, existing approaches to finding exact solutions are limited to the use in problems of small size. This paper presents a hybrid particle swarm optimization (HPSO) algorithm for finding the near-optimal task allocation within reasonable time. The experimental results show that the HPSO is robust against different problem size, task interaction density, and network topology. The proposed method is also more effective and efficient than a genetic algorithm for the test-cases studied. The convergence and the worst-case characteristics of the HPSO are addressed using both theoretical and empirical analysis.",

Data has been collected through questionnaires, focused interviews and non-directive interviews with senior designers. Quantitative data has been analyzed using the Analytic Hierarchical Process (AHP). A trend in the 11 organizations is that there is a statistically significant shift of the main lead-time burden from programming to integration and testing, when distributing systems. From this, it is concluded that processes, tools and technologies that either reduce the need for or the time for testing have an impact on the development and evolution of lead-time of DRTSs.",

The study includes an overall empirical comparison between the models obtained with and without feature selection. Also several classifiers have been tested in order to illustrate the performance of the different filters considered. The results have been contrasted with nonparametric statistical tests and show that our proposal significantly improves the test accuracy of the previous models for the considered data sets. Moreover, the current proposal is much more efficient than a previous methodology developed by us; lastly, the reduction percentage in the number of inputs is above a fifty five, on average.",

This is effective in the Internet of Things (IoT) applications that require standby power reduction. The crystalline oxide semiconductor transistor can constitute a nonvolatile data retention circuit easily because it exhibits significantly lower off-state current than a silicon transistor and is highly compatible with a CMOS logic circuit. The backup circuit can achieve 2-clock-cycle data backup and 4-clock-cycle data restore; thus, the processor system can efficiently perform temporally fine-grained power gating and can achieve longer standby times. Furthermore, area overheads due to the backup circuits are kept very small because the crystalline oxide semiconductor transistors are stacked on silicon transistors.",

    "abstract": "Tight glycemic control (TGC) has shown benefits in ICU patients, but been difficult to achieve consistently due to inter- and intra- patient variability that requires more adaptive, patient-specific solutions. STAR (Stochastic TARgeted) is a flexible model-based TGC framework accounting for patient variability with a stochastically derived maximum 5% risk of blood glucose (BG) below 72mg/dL. This research describes the first clinical pilot trial of the STAR approach and the post-trial analysis of the models and methods that underpin the protocol. The STAR framework works with clinically specified targets and intervention guidelines. The clinically specified glycemic target was 125mg/dL. Each trial was 24h with BG measured 1-2hourly. Two-hourly measurement was used when BG was between 110-135mg/dL for 3h. In the STAR approach, each intervention leads to a predicted BG level and outcome range (5-95th percentile) based on a stochastic model of metabolic patient variability. Carbohydrate intake (all sources) was monitored, but not changed from clinical settings except to prevent BG<100mg/dL when no insulin was given. Insulin infusion rates were limited (6U/h maximum), with limited increases based on current infusion rate (0.5-2.0U/h), making this use of the STAR framework an insulin-only TGC approach. Approval was granted by the Ethics Committee of the Medical Faculty of the University of Liege (Liege, Belgium). Nine patient trials were undertaken after obtaining informed consent. There were 205 measurements over all 9 trials. Median [IQR] per-patient results were: BG: 138.5 [130.6-146.0]mg/dL; carbohydrate administered: 2-11g/h; median insulin:1.3 [0.9-2.4]U/h with a maximum of 6.0 [4.7-6.0]U/h. Median [IQR] time in the desired 110-140mg/dL band was: 50.0 [31.2-54.2]%. Median model prediction errors ranged: 10-18%, with larger errors due to small meals and other clinical events. The minimum BG was 63mg/dL and no other measurement was below 72mg/dL, so only 1 measurement (0.5%) was below the 5% guaranteed minimum risk level. Post-trial analysis showed that patients were more variable than predicted by the stochastic model used for control, resulting in some of the prediction errors seen. Analysis and (validated) virtual trial re-simulating the clinical trial using stochastic models relevant to the patient's particular day of ICU stay were seen to be more accurate in capturing the observed variability. This analysis indicated that equivalent control and safety could be obtained with similar or lower glycemic variability in control using more specific stochastic models. STAR effectively controlled all patients to target. Observed patient variability in response to insulin and thus prediction errors were higher than expected, likely due to the recent insult of cardiac surgery or a major cardiac event, and their immediate recovery. STAR effectively managed this variability with no hypoglycemia. Improved stochastic models will be used to prospectively test these outcomes in further ongoing clinical pilot trials in this and other units.",

Some of these base elements are video streams, and some are three-dimensional graphic displays. The elementary displays of a pop-out video may be related in two ways. They may be contiguous portions of a single virtual world, forming what we call an integrated video space. Alternatively, they may be parts of distinct spaces, forming what we call a complementary video space. In both cases, the elementary displays are related to each other by coordinated event handling. In our on-going research, we are using pop-out videos to create multimedia virtual worlds and to orchestrate the presentation of data in multiple media. After a survey of related work, the paper outlines our initial implementations of pop-out videos and presents future plans.",

    "abstract": "Histopathological grading of cancer is a measure of the cell appearance in malignant neoplasms. Grading offers an insight to the growth of the cancer and helps in developing individual treatment plans. The Nottingham grading system [12], well known method for invasive breast cancer grading, primarily relies on the mitosis count in histopathological slides. Pathologists manually identify mitotic figures from a few thousand slide images for each patient to determine the grade of the cancer. Mitotic figures are hard to identify as the appearance of the mitotic cells change at different phases of mitosis. So, the manual cancer grading is not only a tedious job but also prone to observer variability. We propose a fast and accurate approach for automatic mitosis detection from histopathological images using an enhanced random forest classifier with weighted random trees. The random trees are assigned a tree penalty and a forest penalty depending on their classification performance at the training phase. The weight of a tree is calculated based on these penalties. The forest is trained through regeneration of population from weighted trees. The input data is classified based on weighted voting from the random trees after several populations. Experiments show at least 11 percent improvement in F1 score on more than 450 histopathological images at \u00d740 magnification.",

    "abstract": "Feature extraction is one of the hot topics in face recognition. However, many face extraction methods will suffer from the \"small sample size\" problem, such as Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA). Direct Linear Discriminant Analysis (DLDA) is an effective method to address this problem. But conventional DLDA algorithm is often computationally expensive and not scalable. In this paper, DLDA is analyzed from a new viewpoint via QR decomposition and an efficient and robust method named DLDA/QR algorithm is proposed. The proposed algorithm achieves high efficiency by introducing the QR decomposition on a small-size matrix, while keeping competitive classification accuracy. Experimental results on ORL face database demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method.",

The former can be faced by using ontology-based modeling techniques, while the latter can exploit adaptive systems. The paper presents a software system that combines ontology-based contents modeling and extraction with adaptive, network-aware, content delivery. Contents are extracted from a knowledge base through reasoning modules and are adapted to the user through an adaptive system that takes into account network and terminal characteristics as well as user profile. To optimize the user profiling activity the proposed system uses a P2P profile sharing and updating mechanism. System architecture and a case study in the cultural assets domain are presented.",

We extend the inference machines framework of Ross et al. by adding spatial factors that model mid-range and long-range dependencies inherent in the data. The new model is able to account for semantic spatial context. During training, our method automatically isolates and retains factors modelling spatial dependencies between variables that are relevant for achieving higher prediction accuracy. We evaluate the proposed method by using it to predict 17-category semantic segmentations on sets of stitched Kinect scans. Experimental results show that the spatial dependencies learned by our method significantly improve the accuracy of segmentation. They also show that our method outperforms the existing segmentation technique of Koppula et al.",

    "abstract": "This article deals with the consensus problem involving agents with time-varying singularities in the dynamics or communication in undirected graph networks. Existing results provide control laws which guarantee asymptotic consensus. These results are based on the analysis of a system switching between piecewise constant and time-invariant dynamics. This work introduces a new analysis technique relying upon classical notions of persistence of excitation to study the convergence properties of the time-varying multi-agent dynamics. Since the individual edge weights pass through singularities and vary with time, the closed-loop dynamics consists of a non-autonomous linear system. Instead of simplifying to a piecewise continuous switched system as in literature, smooth variations in edge weights are allowed, albeit assuming an underlying persistence condition which characterizes sufficient inter-agent communication to reach consensus. The consensus task is converted to edge-agreement in order to study a stabilization problem to which classical persistence based results apply. The new technique allows precise computation of the rate of convergence to the consensus value.",

    "abstract": "IaaS cloud providers, as Amazon or Rackspace, provide their users with the abilities to create an own virtual environment, populate it with their applications, and manage a wide range of critical issues (e.g. scale up/down, load balancing, faults) by means of ad hoc services. One of the limits of these cloud systems is the lack of tools that enable the user to have a direct knowledge of the physical resources supporting his application. Some providers supply a set of tools for the monitoring of the user application (e.g. CloudWatch) but these present several limits: the monitoring time is constrained by the provider, the mechanism to get the values of the state is not always clear, the observation procedure introduces an overhead unquantifiable and, in some cases, not always negligible. To overcome such a limitation, this paper introduces UCMS, an autonomic user-side management system to monitor and control the behaviour of users applications on a Cloud environment. The main advantages offered by UCMS is its ability to modify at run-time the Components-Virtual Machines-Physical Machines mapping, previously established by both the user (components-virtual machines) and cloud provider (virtual machines-physical machines) in order to improve the exploitation of the assigned resources. Experiments led on real scenario (Amazon EC2) demonstrate the ability of UCMS to reduce the execution time of considered cloud applications (Pipeline and MapReduce) by about 50%.",

We discuss how GPS tracking, web-based mapping, and mobile applications allow cooperatives to collect, manage, and interpret spatial data themselves, and to redesign their own system collaboratively with others.

In practice, CAD systems have different strengths and weaknesses and it is therefore interesting to consider their combination. In this paper, we present generic methods to combine multiple CAD systems and investigate what kind of performance increase can be expected. Experimental results are presented using data from the ANODE09 and ROC09 online CAD challenges for the detection of pulmonary nodules in computed tomography scans and red lesions in retinal images, respectively. For both applications, combination results in a large and significant increase in performance when compared to the best individual CAD system.",

    "abstract": "The bit error rate of a binary phase shift keying (BPSK) signal in Ricean-faded cochannel interference is studied. A precise bit error rate expression is derived for a bandlimited BPSK signal corrupted by an arbitrary number of asynchronous Ricean-faded interfering signals. An error rate estimation based on a saddlepoint approximation is also provided. It is shown that this approximation is highly accurate. For the special case, when there is one synchronous Ricean-faded interfering signal in an interference-limited environment, an asymptotic error rate analysis based on the saddle point approximation reveals that fading in the cochannel interfering signal can have different impacts on the desired user's error rate performance. Our study shows that when the signal-to-interference ratio (SIR) is sufficiently large, the error floor of the desired user signal decreases with an increase of the Rice factor in the interfering user's fading channel. However, the opposite phenomenon can happen when the SIR is small.",

    "abstract": "Infectious disease outbreaks, caused by nature or bioterrorism, are unfortunately very real threats to the general population. Planning an effective response to an infectious disease outbreak requires a coordinated effort in multiple locations to best allocate the limited resources. This decision problem is further complicated by the non-linear nature of disease propagation and the fact that outbreaks can jump urban, even national, boundaries. In this work we present a multi-city resource allocation model to distribute a limited amount of vaccine in order to minimize the total number of fatalities due to a smallpox outbreak. The model decides the amount of limited supplies to deliver and which infection control measure (isolation, ring, or mass vaccination) to use in each location in order to decrease the number of fatalities. The proposed model approximates the disease propagation dynamics in order to represent the problem as a mixed integer programming problem. Furthermore we develop an efficient heuristic to solve the resulting large scale mixed integer programming problem. Our results analyze the quality of the approximate disease propagation model and the efficiency of the heuristic algorithm. We also conduct a case study applying the multi-city model in planning an emergency response to a hypothetical national smallpox outbreak, which shows the possibility of saving a significant number of lives compared with a prorated allocation policy.",

    "abstract": "Psychophysical and neurophysiological evidence about the human visual system shows the existence of a mechanism, called surround suppression, which inhibits the response of an edge in the presence of other similar edges in the surroundings. A simple computational model of this phenomenon has been previously proposed by us, by introducing an inhibition term that is supposed to be high on texture and low on isolated edges. While such an approach leads to better discrimination between object contours and texture edges w.r.t. methods based on the sole gradient magnitude, it has two drawbacks: first, a phenomenon called self-inhibition occurs, so that the inhibition term is quite high on isolated contours too; previous attempts to overcome self-inhibition result in slow and inelegant algorithms. Second, an input parameter called ''inhibition level'' needs to be introduced, whose value is left to heuristics. The contribution of this paper is two-fold: on one hand, we propose a new model for the inhibition term, based on the theory of steerable filters, to reduce self-inhibition. On the other hand, we introduce a simple method to combine the binary edge maps obtained by different inhibition levels, so that the inhibition level is no longer specified by the user. The proposed approach is validated by a broad range of experimental results.",

    "abstract": "Cloud computing platforms are well established as the reference infrastructure for flexibility allowing business to scale according to user demands. However, several challenges remain to be addressed. Scaling up the infrastructure to match up the resource demand of the users is relatively straight forward. However in order to save up on power consumption, cloud providers have to dynamically consolidate the virtual machines (VM), so that only a reduced subset of hosts remains powered on. To solve this issue, the cloud scheduler, which handles the VM allocations, has to balance between providing enough resource to each user, and reducing the overall power consumption of the cloud. In this paper we investigate the VM allocation and reallocation inside a cloud in order to save energy while maintaining the resources required by users. Such actions have to be made in order to minimize the number of hosts powered on, while limiting concurrent migrations of virtual machines, and in a reasonable computational time. We propose to effectively consolidate virtual machines with an approach handling the reallocation, migration and host management problems. Our approach has been implemented in OpenNebula, and experimentally compared with its default approach.",

    "abstract": "In this work, we investigate the use of epidemic routing in energy constrained Delay Tolerant Networks (DTNs). In DTNs, connected paths between source and destination rarely materialize due to the mobility and sparse density of nodes. Epidemic routing is well-suited for these environments due to its simplicity and fully distributed implementation. In epidemic routing, messages are relayed by intermediate nodes at contact opportunities, i.e., when pairs of nodes come within transmission range. Each node needs to decide whether to forward its message upon contact with a new node based on its residual energy level and the age of that message.   We mathematically characterize the fundamental trade-off between energy conservation and forwarding efficacy as a heterogeneous dynamic energy-dependent optimal control problem. We prove, somewhat surprisingly given the complex nature of the problem, that in the mean field regime, the optimal dynamic forwarding decisions follow simple threshold-based structures in which the forwarding threshold for each node depends on its current remaining energy. We analytically establish this result under generalized classes of utility functions for DTNs. We then characterize the dependence of these thresholds on current energy reserves in each node.",

A model incorporating the sigmadeg phi-modulation and spatial inhomogeneity is proposed. Surface slope variations are related to the sigmadeg spatial inhomogeneity. We compare the backscatter model results with numerically predicted wind direction data provided by the European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts (ECMWF) over the erg surfaces. We use the maxima of the phi-modulation at thetas=33deg to infer the orientation of the dominant slip-sides on the sand surface. These orientations are consistent with the ECMWF wind directions spatially and temporally",

    "abstract": "Presents a new scheduler, the two-dimensional round-robin (2DRR) scheduler, that provides high throughput and fair access in a packet switch that uses multiple input queues. We consider an architecture in which each input port maintains a separate queue for each output. In an N/spl times/N switch, our scheduler determines which of the queues in the total of N/sup 2/ input queues are served during each time slot. We demonstrate the fairness properties of the 2DRR scheduler and compare its performance with that of the input and output queueing configurations, showing that our scheme achieves the same saturation throughput as output queueing. The 2DRR scheduler can be implemented using simple logic components, thereby allowing a very high-speed implementation. >",

    "abstract": "In mobile communications, mobility modeling is involved in several aspects such as signaling and traffic load analysis. In particular, accuracy of mobility models become essential for the evaluation of system design alternatives and network implementation cost issues. In this paper we propose a new method in which many important issues such as streets topology and traffic conditions are considered to model the user movement in a real environment. By using this model we also propose a new intelligent algorithm based on a sub-optimum path finding method to find a proper path between source and destination. The proposed model is suitable for modification for random waypoint model and can be applied in mobile network simulation and intelligent transport system control",

    "abstract": "This paper studies the status of storage tanks in petroleum distribution network under uncertainty. It is difficult to describe the topology of this network precisely. As an instance, the capacity of pipelines and tanks due to corrosion cannot be presented as real numbers. Also production of oil fields, demand of costumers and food of refineries in a long-term programming are given under uncertainty. The contribution of this paper is to capture with the corresponding granular information applying fuzzy concepts. For this mission, an off-line basic framework is proposed in order to find the least daily-transportation-cost of crude oil flows through a capacitated network. To transform this management problem into a traditional minimal cost flow problem (MCFP), a T-floors network is provided which simulates the oil transportation in T days. The dummy links adjoining two consecutive floors are embedded as storage depots and their flows are corresponded to maintained flow. To exhibit with imprecision concerning this dynamic network, a fuzzifier can be applied which obtains a fuzzy number reflecting system description. Then a fully fuzzified MCFP is solved applying a ranking function understood by authors in previous works. We illustrate the performance of the proposed scheme on a simplified pilot of Iranian petroleum industry network. Furthermore, we offer a modified version of successive shortest path algorithm which is able to find the optimal place and the optimal capacity of storage tanks when they are required through the long-term programming period.",

    "abstract": "article i nfo Diffusion tensor imaging has been widely used to study brain diseases, disorders, development, and aging. However, few studies have explored the effects of aging on diffusion imaging measures with higher b values. Further, the water diffusion in biological tissues appears biexponential, although this also has not been explored with aging. In this study, hybrid diffusion imaging (HYDI) was used to study 52 healthy subjects with an age range from 18 to 72 years. The HYDI diffusion-encoding scheme consisted of five concentric q-space shells with b values ranging from 0 to 9375 s/mm 2 . Quantitative diffusion measures were investigated as a function of age and gender using both region-of-interest (whole-brain white matter, genu and splenium of corpus callosum, posterior limb of the internal capsule) and whole-brain voxel-based analyses. Diffusion measures included measures of the diffusion probability density function (zero displacement probability and mean-squared displacement), biexponential diffusion (i.e., volume fractions of fast/slow diffusion compart- ments and fast/slow diffusivities), and DTI measures (fractional anisotropy, mean diffusivity, axial diffusivity, and radial diffusivity). The biexponential volume fraction, the fast diffusivity, and the axial diffusivity measures (f1, D1, and Da) were found to be more sensitive to normal aging than the restricted, slow and radial diffusion measures (P0, D2, and Dr). The biexponential volume fraction, f1, showed the most widespread age dependence in the voxel-based analyses, although both FA and mean diffusivity did show changes in frontal white matter regions that may be associated with age-related decline.",

    "abstract": "This paper presents new experimental and numerical methods to characterize the transfer overmolding of substrates with epoxy polymer. We investigated Multi Chip Modules on ceramic panels as well as on printed circuit boards encapsulated as a Mold Array Package (MAP). Experiments show that the polymer flow during the overmolding process depends significantly on the mold height: While standard MAP-type mold cavities are filled homogeneously and symmetrically in most cases, low cavity heights (<500lm) can cause the flow front to concentrate on a few flow paths (flow front fingering). We developed a numerical method to describe this inhomogeneous polymer flow. The reason for flow front fingering seems to be local variations of polymer viscosity which enforces a necking on distinct flow paths. Fingering can cause the formation of air traps and excessive wire sweep. We also developed new experimental methods to measure the pressure distribution within cavities: our sensor is based on commercially available, passive pressure sensitive films from FUJUFILM and is operational at temperatures up to 180.",

    "abstract": "The increasing complexity of embedded systems is pushing their design to System-Level, thus leading to a convergence between software and hardware. Consequently, operating systems in this realm are also being required to deliver their services both as software and as hardware. In such a scenario, it is desirable to verify system properties regardless of whether its components are instantiated at software or hardware. In this paper, we describe an approach to formally verify functional correctness and safety properties of such system-level component. The approach is illustrated by a case study of EPOS' scheduler, whose implementation can be driven to yield both a software instance compiled by the GCC C++ compiler or a hardware instance synthesized by the CatapultC ESL tool. We demonstrate that the scheduler follows its specification regardless of the domain for which it is instantiated. We also demonstrate that the proposed approach causes no run-time overhead, since the adopted Software Model Checking techniques are deployed at compile-time.",

DoppleSleep provides a single sensor solution to track sleep-related physical and physiological variables including coarse body movements and subtle and fine-grained chest, heart movements due to breathing and heartbeat. By integrating vital signals and body movement sensing, DoppleSleep achieves 89.6% recall with Sleep vs. Wake classification and 80.2% recall with REM vs. Non-REM classification compared to EEG-based sleep sensing. Lastly, it provides several objective sleep quality measurements including sleep onset latency, number of awakenings, and sleep efficiency. The contactless nature of DoppleSleep obviates the need to instrument the user's body with sensors. Lastly, DoppleSleep is implemented on an ARM microcontroller and a smartphone application that are benchmarked in terms of power and resource usage.",

    "abstract": "We are developing a new landmine detection system, namely advanced landmine imaging system (ALIS), which is equipped with metal detector (MD) and ground penetrating radar (GPR). Despite it is a hand-held system, we can record the MD and GPR signals together with the sensor position information acquired by CCD camera. Therefore, MD image and GPR image can be obtained after signal processing. Since ALIS is a hand-held system, the sensor position is random when it is operated in the field. So interpolation processing is needed to provide a gridded data set for both MD and GPR. A good MD image can be achieved after interpolation. Also, interpolation can prepare the gridded data set for migration. 3D Kirchhoff migration is used to enhance the signal-clutter ratio for effective image reconstruction. The ALIS was tested in Afghanistan in December 2004 and showed a good performance. In particular, the GPR could obtain a good image of anti-personnel (AP) mine buried at more than 20 cm depth. Also images from both sensors could be combined to distinguish a mine from a metal fragment.",

    "abstract": "This paper introduces the problem of finding the least expected travel time path between two nodes in a network with travel times that are both random and time-dependent (e.g., a truck, rail, air or bus network). It first shows that standard shortest path algorithms (such as the Dijkstra algorithm) do not find the minimum expected travel time path on such a network, then proposes a method which does find the minimum path. Next, this paper shows that the optimal \u201croute choice\u201d is not a simple path but an adaptive decision rule. The best route from any given node to the final destination depends on the arrival time at that node. Because the arrival time is not known before departing the origin, a better route can be selected by deferring the final choice until later nodes are reached. A method for finding the optimal adaptive decision rule is proposed.",

    "abstract": "We illustrate an approach to uncertain knowledge based on lower conditional probability bounds. We exploit the coherence principle of de Finetti and a related notion of generalized coherence (g-coherence), which is equivalent to the \"avoiding uniform loss\" property introduced by Walley for lower and upper probabilities. Based on the additive structure of random gains, we define suitable notions of non relevant gains and of basic sets of variables. Exploiting them, the linear systems in our algorithms can work with reduced sets of variables and/or constraints. In this paper, we illustrate the notions of non relevant gain and of basic set by examining several cases of imprecise assessments defined on families with three conditional events. We adopt a geometrical approach, obtaining some necessary and sufficient conditions for g-coherence. We also propose two algorithms which provide new strategies for reducing the number of constraints and for deciding g-coherence. In this way, we try to overcome the computational difficulties which arise when linear systems become intractable. Finally, we illustrate our methods by giving some examples.",

    "abstract": "Embracing real use in an iterative approach calls for systematic formative evaluation. Effects-driven IT Development has been suggested as a way of supporting a Participatory Design (PD) process involving implementations that expose mature prototypes to real work practices. This is followed by evaluations of how specified and desired effects are obtained. We present results from a project where high-level political goals ('More Warm Hands'; i.e., clinicians spending more time at the patient bedside) are aligned with the local clinical organization and practice. We demonstrate how to combine quantitative and qualitative methods to address various levels of 'use' from overall politics to actual practice. The project concerns the introduction and use of an electronic whiteboard system to support clinical overview and logistics at emergency departments (EDs). The nurses succeed in getting 'warmer hands' while the physicians have good reasons for not pursuing this aim after all. The study contributes to a growing bulk of literature on how to include PD in the later stages of iterative development.",

User-Centered design approaches encourage an early focus on users and their contexts of use, but these need to be integrated with approaches for engineering secure systems. This paper describes how personas can augment a process for eliciting and specifying requirements for secure and usable systems. Our results suggest that personas increase stakeholder empathy towards users represented by personas, and the empirical data used to build personas can also be used to obtain a better understanding of prospective attackers and their motivations.",

For example, Youtube's video popularity has been measured by crawling either related videos or videos belonging to certain categories or by using a list of, e.g., the most recent videos as the data-source. In this paper we demonstrate that all these methods lead to a biased sample of data when compared to a random sample. We demonstrate the bias by comparing the differently sampled data sets in terms of different commonly used metrics, such as video pop- ularity, age, length, or category. The results show that different sampling methods lead to significantly different values in the metrics, thus poten- tially leading to very different conclusions about the system under study. The goal of the paper is not to provide yet-another-set-of-numbers for YouTube; instead we seek to emphasize the importance of using correct measurement methodologies and understanding the inherent weaknesses of different methodologies.",

    "abstract": "Over the past few decades, users have been feeling clumsy inputting Chinese on mobile devices, partly because the layout of the keyboard/keypad is originally designed for inputting Latin alphabets. To improve this user experience, we propose Stroke++, a novel Chinese input method for touch screen mobile devices. More specifically, Stroke++ provides efficient keypad layout, a friendly user interface and a intelligent character/phrase candidate set generation algorithms. Stroke++ splits a Chinese character into multiple radicals. By leveraging hieroglyphic properties of Chinese characters, our method requires users to only input a subset of the radicals to identify the target character, making it much faster and easier to input Chinese on mobile phones. Our user study results show that Stroke++ outperforms most major Chinese input methods on mobile devices, including Stroke, Pinyin and Hand Writing Recognition (HWR), in terms of the input efficiency and usability. Moreover, we also demonstrate that Stroke++ offers a low entry barrier for Chinese-input novices.",

First, analysis of coding algorithm is provided by using a RISC model to obtain the proper degrees of parallelism under SDTV specification. Second, a two-stage macroblock pipelining is proposed to double the processing capability and hardware utilization. Third, Hadamard-based mode decision is modified as DCT-based version to reduce the 40% of memory access. To sum up, our system architecture achieves 215 times of speed compared with RISC-based software implementation in terms of processing cycles. In addition, we also made a lot of efforts on developing area-speed efficient modules. Reconfigurable intra predictor generator can support all kinds of prediction modes. Parallel multi-transform has four times throughput of the serial one with little area overhead. CAVLC engine can efficiently provide coding information for the bitstream packer. A prototype chip was fabricated with TSMC 0.25 /spl mu/m CMOS technology and is capable of encoding 720/spl times/480 4:2:0 30 Hz video in real time at the working frequency of 54 MHz.

    "abstract": "This article is devoted to the output-feedback \u210b\u221e control problem for switched linear systems subject to actuator saturation. We consider both continuous- and discrete-time switched systems. Using the minimal switching rule, nonlinear output feedbacks expressed in the form of quasi-linear parameter varying system are designed to satisfy a pre-specified disturbance attenuation level defined by the regional \u21122 (l2)-gains over a class of energy-bounded disturbances. The conditions are expressed in bilinear matrix inequalities and can be solved by line search coupled with linear matrix inequalities optimisation. A spherical inverted pendulum example is used to illustrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach.",

    "abstract": "Viability theory can be applied for determining viable capture basin for control problem in presence of uncertainty. We first recall the concepts of viability theory which allow to develop numerical methods for computing viable capture basin for control problems and guaranteed control problems. Recent developments of option pricing in the framework of dynamical games with constraints lead to the formulation of guaranteed valuation in terms of guaranteed viable-capture basin of a dynamical game. As an application we show how the viability/capturability algorithm evaluates and manages portfolios. Regarding viability/capturability issues, stochastic control is a particular use of tychastic control. We replace the standard translation of uncertainty by stochastic control problem by tychastic ones and the concept of stochastic viability by the one of guaranteed viability kernel. Considering the Cox\u2013Rubinstein model, we extend algorithms for hedging portfolios in the presence of transaction costs and dividends using recent developments on hybrid calculus.",

We give simulations of each other in the style of the proofs-as-programs correspondence; proof nets correspond to Boolean circuits and cut-elimination corresponds to evaluation. The depth of a proof net is defined to be the maximum logical depth of cut formulas in it, and it is shown that every unbounded fan-in Boolean circuit of depth n, possibly with stC0NN/sub 2/ gates, is polynomially simulated by a proof net of depth O(n) and vice versa. Here, stC0NN/sub 2/ stands for st-connectivity gates for undirected graphs of degree 2.

    "abstract": "Transformation optics is an emerging technique for the design of advanced electromagnetic media. Transformation optical devices exploit the form invariance of Maxwell's equations, allowing geometry to play the dominant role in the design process rather than traditional wave or ray optics. The use of coordinate transformations vastly eases the burden of design for a large class of devices, though at the expense of increasing the complexity of the underlying materials used. Although the required constitutive parameters of a transformation optical structure can be challenging-inherently anisotropic and spatially varying, with both magnetic and electric response-nevertheless the parameter requirements can often be met or approximated through the use of artificially structured metamaterials. Here, we review the basic concepts associated with transformation optics and provide several examples to illustrate its application.",

    "abstract": "In Dynamically Reconfigurable Processors (DRPs), compilation involves breaking an application into sub-tasks for piecewise execution on the fabric. These sub-tasks are sequenced based on data and control dependences. In DRPs, sub-task prefetching is used to hide the reconfiguration time while another sub-task executes. In REDEFINE, our target DRP, subtasks are referred to as HyperOps. Determining the successor for a HyperOp requires merging information from the control flow graph and the HyperOp dataflow graph. Succession in many cases is data dependent. Since hardware branch predictors cannot be applied due to the non-binary branches, we employ a speculative prefetch unit together with a profile based prediction scheme. Simulation results show around 7-33% reduction in overall execution time, when compared to the execution time without prefetching. We observe better performance when fewer resources on the fabric are used to execute prefetched HyperOps.",

The simulations are carried out on the LMGC90 platform based on the Non Smooth Contact Dynamics method. The first attempt consists in evaluating the load transfer though the structural elements thanks to a 3D rigid modelling made of 5000 blocks. Special features to generate the complex geometry are also presented. Results obtained from the rigid model are then suitably used to perform a Finite Element Analysis on a deformable block subjected to different factors of degradation. A discussion enlightens the part played by each scenario and finally brings informations for the restoration process.",

    "abstract": "Behavior analysis of social insects has garnered impetus in recent years and has led to some advances in fields like control systems and flight navigation. Manual labeling of insect motions required for analyzing the behaviors of insects requires significant investment of time and effort. In this paper, we propose certain general principles that help in simultaneous automatic tracking and behavior analysis, with applications in tracking bees and recognizing specific behaviors that they exhibit. The state space for tracking is defined using the position, orientation, and current behavior of the insect being tracked. The position and the orientation are parameterized using a shape model, whereas the behavior is explicitly modeled using a three-tier hierarchical motion model. The first tier (dynamics) models the local motions exhibited, and the models built in this tier act as a vocabulary for behavior modeling. The second tier is a Markov motion model built on top of the local motion vocabulary, which serves as the behavior model. The third tier of the hierarchy models the switching between behaviors, and this is also modeled as a Markov model. We address issues in learning the three-tier behavioral model, in discriminating between models, and in detecting and modeling abnormal behaviors. Another important aspect of this work is that it leads to joint tracking and behavior analysis instead of the traditional \"track-and-then-recognize\" approach. We apply these principles for tracking bees in a hive while they are executing the waggle dance and the round dance.",

The workbench was designed to support the annotation of XML coded linguistic corpora, but it could be used to annotate any kind of data, as it is not dependent on any particular annotation scheme. Rather than being a general purpose XML-aware editor it is a system for writing specialised editors tailored to a particular annotation task. A particular editor is defined using a transformation language, with suitable display formats and allowable editing operations. The workbench is written in Java, which means that it is platform-independent. This paper outlines the design of the workbench software and compares it with other annotation programs.",

Our model - calibrated by an automatic fitting procedure - simultaneously reproduces thresholds for four classical pattern discrimination tasks, performed while attention was engaged by another concurrent task. Our model then predicts that the seemingly complex improvements of certain thresholds, which we observed when attention was fully available for the discrimination tasks, can best be explained by a strengthening of competition among early visual filters.",

    "abstract": "In this paper, we propose a novel label propagation algorithm named Proxy-based Local Consistency Propagation (PLCP), in which the label information is first propagated from labeled examples to the unlabeled ones, and then spreads only among unlabeled ones mutually until a steady state is reached. To meet the requirements of efficiency in many real-world image annotation applications, we propose an online semi-supervised annotation framework where the new examples can be predicted and used to update the model. Specifically, we extend PLCP to work under an inductive setting and propose an incremental model updating method that can incorporate the new examples including labeled and unlabeled examples. The comprehensive experiments on MNIST, CIFAR-10 and PIE datasets show that our proposed PLCP achieves superior performance compared with the baselines, and our proposed incremental model updating method can achieve significant promotion in efficiency, with the nearly identical accuracy compared to re-training.",

InFO WLCSP can use either Aluminum (Al) pads or Copper (Cu) pillars as contact interfaces. Cu pillars without solder caps are selected as the contact interface due to their superior area and cost efficiency. However, there are some challenges due to Cu oxidation and its small size. In this paper we propose a novel methodology that leads to a very high precision test resulting in better yield for mass production of InFO WLCSP packages. We will show results on some industrial designs to validate our claims.",

    "abstract": "A method to select the lengths of functional sequences in a BIST scheme for scan designs is proposed in this paper. A functional sequence is a sequence of primary input vectors applied when the circuit operates as a sequential circuit, without using scan. These sequences can be applied at-speed, i.e., at the normal circuit clock speed. The objectives set for choosing the lengths of the functional sequences are to increase the number of vectors applied at-speed, and to reduce the number of settings of functional sequence lengths, without compromising the fault coverage achieved. The experimental results presented demonstrate that compared to earlier methods, the proposed method achieves the above objectives while also achieving higher fault coverages for most of the benchmark circuits considered.",

    "abstract": "A commonly accepted technique in hardware/software co-design is to implement as many system functions as possible in software and to move performance critical functions into special-purpose external hardware in order to either satisfy timing constraints or reduce the overall execution time of a program - this is known as \"software acceleration\". This paper investigates the limits to the performance enhancements obtainable using software acceleration techniques. A practical target architecture, based on the use of programmable logic, is used to illustrate the problems associated with software acceleration. It is shown that normally little benefit can be obtained by applying software acceleration methods to general-purpose applications. Whereas software acceleration can profitably be used in a limited number of special-purpose applications, a designer would probably be better off developing ASIP components, based on heterogeneous multiprocessor architectures.",

    "abstract": "The advent of the internet has revolutionized the field of advertising by providing a whole new path for reaching potential customers. Studies show that online advertising is, on the whole, extremely effective and that consumer acceptance of online advertising is comparable to traditional media[7][8]. One of the reasons for the high effectiveness of online advertising is that users interact with the web at a far more personal and intimate level than they interact with other advertising media like the radio or television. Pervasive computing environments deal with users at an even more intimate level; hence such environments are even better advertising platforms than the web. Pervasive environments allow the delivery of relevant advertising in suitable ways to selected consumers. In this paper, we examine some of the possibilities of pervasive advertising as well as some of the issues involved.",

Intelligent use of temporal redundancy present in video frames paves the way for real-time implementation. Any fog removal algorithm for images acquired with uncalibrated single camera system can be extended to video using the proposed framework. For the purpose of real-time implementation, several fog removal algorithms for images are investigated and few top ranking algorithms in speed and quality are chosen. Simulation results confirm that proposed framework reduces the computation per frame significantly. Proposed fog removal framework has a wide application in navigation, transportation, and other industries.",

    "abstract": "Supporting social interactions is a long-term focus for Human Computer Interaction (HCI) and Computer Supported Cooperative Work (CSCW). However, understanding how social and emotional skills are learned, and how this process can be supported by technology, is an important but underresearched area in HCI so far. To address this gap, we review existing approaches to social and emotions skills learning (SEL) in other fields, with a specific focus on SEL in education, in which a large number of evidence-based programs is widely deployed. In doing so, the primary aim of this article is to provide a foundation and set an agenda for future research on the design of technology that would support, and help teach, social and emotional skills. We identify the key challenges to successful learning shared by SEL programs in education\u2014such as embedding skills learned in class also into everyday situations, promoting reflection, and providing additional opportunities for practice\u2014and outline how these could be addressed by digital technology. Overall, our key argument is that much existing HCI work could be used in support of social and emotional skills learning in education, and possibly other domains, but that the topic has not been explored so far. We also highlight how the focus on supporting SEL would bring novel opportunities and challenges for HCI, as well as provide a basis for a strong HCI research agenda in this space.",

The center frequency of the modulator can be varied from fs/14 to 6fs/14 at a sampling frequency (fs) of 70 MHz. Its performance can be hence improved by fine tuning the center frequency. The purposed modulator was implemented in 0.35-/spl mu/m 2P4M CMOS standard technology with the core area of 4.2 mm/sup 2/. The measured dynamic range of 68 dB within 200 kHz bandwidth can be achieved. Its power consumption is 58 mW under a 3.3-V supply voltage.",

In particualr, we show how we can use different kinds of information in the compilation of CHRs in order to obtain access efficiency, and a better translation of the CHR rules into the underlying language. The kinds of information used include the types, modes, determinism, functional dependencies and symmetries of the CHR constraints.

In this paper, we tackle the problem of inferring human mobility trace under the circumstance that the recorded location information exhibits missing data. Based on the tensor voting theory, we propose an efficient sparse tensor voting algorithm and a specified implementation scheme. The model is constructed based on the geometric connections between the input signals and encodes the structure information in the tensor matrix. Thus, the computation is carried out in the form of matrix, which reduces the computation load since most the calculation involves only with matrix addition and multiplication. The proposed method is applied to real human mobility trace. The results show that our proposed approach effectively recovers human mobility trace from the incomplete data input.",

In Linux kernel, the problem of heat generation by CPUs is tackled by the thermal subsystem. The thermal subsystem limits the heat generation due to CPUs by limiting the maximum frequency of a CPU. This is made possible by a HW specific driver to control the operating points of CPU. This paper presents a novel approach to tackle the heat generation in CPUs. In this paper a temperature aware scheduler is proposed where temperature of CPU core is considered as an important parameter in task placement decisions. The method intends to lower the heat generated by CPUs and lower the number of thermal mitigations done by the thermal subsystem. The test results performed on an embedded device showed a trend of significantly delayed thermal mitigations and better performance in general compared to stock kernel.",

Specifically, the a priori knowledge about which range measurements are biased, and the probability density functions (pdf) of the biases are assumed to be available. For each range measurement, the error due to estimating the time-of-arrival (TOA) of the detected signal is modeled as a Gaussian distributed random variable with zero mean and known variance. In general, the derived CRB expression can be evaluated numerically. An approximate CRB expression is also derived when the bias pdf is very informative. Using these CRB expressions, we study the impact of the bias distribution on the mean square error (MSE) bound corresponding to the CRB. The analysis is corroborated by numerical experiments.",

Subtraction stereo is a stereo vision method that focuses on the movement of objects to make a stereo camera robust and produces range images for moving regions. Features of pedestrians such as 3D position, height and width are obtained from range images obtained by subtraction stereo. Then a simple method to remove shadows is proposed. The basic algorithm of the subtraction stereo is implemented on a commercially available stereo camera, and the effectiveness of the method to detect pedestrians with removal of shadows is verified by experiments using the stereo camera.",

They showed that triangle-free is a sucient condition for a graph to be uniquely intersectable. In 1990, Tsuchiya (On intersection graphs with respect to antichains (II), Utilities Math. 37 (1996) 29{44) studied the concept of unique intersectability with respect to antichains and showed that triangle-free is also a sucient condition for a graph to be uniquely intersectable with respect to antichains. In this paper we generalize the above results by proving that if a graph is diamond-free and twins-free, then it is uniquely intersectable and if a graph is diamond-free and nonpendant brothers-free, then it is uniquely intersectable with respect to antichains. Also we characterize diamond-free graphs that are uniquely intersectable and the line graphs of triangle-free graphs that are uniquely intersectable. We also consider the concept of unique intersectability with respect to multifamilies and obtain a characterization of such graphs. c 1999 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.",

On purpose two different F-LPFGs were used to measure temperature variations, taking advantage of their broad spectrum and the slope characteristics of the erbium light source. This approach affected the spectrum gain as the linear band shifting took place. The measured sensitivity of the long period fiber gratings were about 72 pm/\u00b0C in a range from 25 to 500 \u00b0C. Here, the temperature rate of the experiment was 0.17 \u00b0C/s and the temperature response time was within 3 s. Moreover, temperature changes were detected with an InGaAs photodetector, where a sensitivity of 0.05 mV/\u00b0C was achieved.",

    "abstract": "Head pose classification from surveillance images acquired with distant, large field-of-view cameras is difficult as faces are captured at low-resolution and have a blurred appearance. Domain adaptation approaches are useful for transferring knowledge from the training (source) to the test (target) data when they have different attributes, minimizing target data labeling efforts in the process. This paper examines the use of transfer learning for efficient multi-view head pose classification with minimal target training data under three challenging situations: (i) where the range of head poses in the source and target images is different, (ii) where source images capture a stationary person while target images capture a moving person whose facial appearance varies under motion due to changing perspective, scale and (iii) a combination of (i) and (ii). On the whole, the presented methods represent novel transfer learning solutions employed in the context of multi-view head pose classification. We demonstrate that the proposed solutions considerably outperform the state-of-the-art through extensive experimental validation. Finally, the DPOSE dataset compiled for benchmarking head pose classification performance with moving persons, and to aid behavioral understanding applications is presented in this work.",

    "abstract": "It is immensely challenging to devise a voting system that guarantees both the correct reflection of the will of the voters and the secrecy of the ballots, based solely on compelling, objective evidence. In response to this challenge, various voting protocols have been proposed, typically using cryptography, that seek to base the assurance of accuracy on transparency and auditability. This approach is neatly captured by the maxim ''verify the election results, not the voting system!''. Such protocols strive to achieve a new requirement, that of voter-verifiability: voters are able to confirm that their vote is accurately counted while maintaining ballot secrecy. This paper describes the concept of voter-verifiability, and it outlines a particular voting protocol, the Pret a Voter protocol, for achieving voter-verifiability. A new version of the protocol that exploits some special features of the Paillier encryption algorithm is presented. This gives a more elegant and robust implementation of Pret a Voter than the previous versions. In particular, the fact that Paillier encryption allows the secret key holder to recover the randomisation as well as the plaintext, enables a simplified auditing of the ballot receipts and avoids the need to provide Zero-Knowledge Proofs. The use of Verified Random Functions is proposed as a way to prevent any manipulation undermining the secrecy requirements. Finally, a new construction of the ballot forms used in the Pret a Voter protocol is presented that allows the ballot forms to carry full permutations of the candidates rather than simple cyclic shifts of earlier, re-encryption mix versions of this protocol.",

    "abstract": "A potential explanation of a fact is a hypothesis such that, if it were true, it would explain the fact in question. Let\u2019s suppose that we become aware of a fact and some potential explanations thereof. Let\u2019s also suppose that we would like to believe the truth. Given this aim, we can ask two questions. First, is it likely that one of these hypotheses is true? Second, given an affirmative answer to the first question, which one is it likely to be? Inference to the best explanation (IBE) offers answers to both questions. To the first, it says \u2018Yes\u2019\u2014assuming that at least one of the hypotheses would, if true, provide a satisfactory explanation of the fact under consideration. To the second, it says that the hypothesis most likely to be true is the one that scores best on the explanatory virtues: conservatism, modesty, simplicity, generality, and predictive power. Many philosophers have argued against IBE\u2019s answer to the first question. I am interested in an objection to its answer to the second. Many philosophers seem to think that it is unsustainable: they seem to think that even if we assume that one of the competing hypotheses is true, we should not think that IBE will help us to identify it. Or, more carefully, if these philosophers are doing what they appear to be doing\u2014namely, offering critiques of IBE that don\u2019t depend on assumptions about the field of competing hypotheses\u2014then their claim is that IBE will not help us to identify the truth. I believe that this is mistaken: the argument for believing it assumes a model of IBE that we have no reason to accept.",

    "abstract": "Several recent studies identify the memory system as the most frequent source of hardware failures in commercial servers. Techniques to protect the memory system from failures must continue to service memory requests, despite hardware failures. Furthermore, to support existing OS's, the physical address space must be retained following reconfiguration. Existing techniques either suffer from a high performance overhead or require pervasive hardware changes to support transparent recovery. In this paper, we propose physical address indirection (PAI), a lightweight, hardware-based mechanism for memory system failure recovery. PAI provides a simple hardware mapping to transparently reconstruct affected data in alternate locations, while maintaining high performance and avoiding physical address changes. With full-system simulation of commercial and scientific workloads on a 16-node distributed shared memory server, we show that prior techniques have an average degraded mode performance loss of 14 % and 51 % for commercial and scientific workloads, respectively. Using PAI's data- swap reconstruction, the same workloads have 1 % and 32 % average performance losses.",

We thus bridge the gap between the situations described in [E. Sandier and S. Serfaty, Rev. Math. Phys., 12 (2000), pp. 1219--1257] and [X. B. Pan, Comm. Math. Phys., 228 (2002), pp. 327--370]. We prove estimates on the energy, among them one by an algebraic trick inspired by the Bogomoln'yi trick for self-duality.

    "abstract": "In the past years, telecommunications networks have seen an important evolution with the advances in optical technologies and the explosive growth of the Internet. Several optical systems allow a very large transport capacity, and data traffic has dramatically increased. Telecommunications networks are now moving towards a model of high-speed routers interconnected by intelligent optical core networks. Moreover, there is a general consensus that the control plan of the optical networks should utilize IP-based protocols for dynamic provisioning and restoration of lightpaths. The interaction of the IP routers with the optical core networks permits to achieve end-to-end connections, and the lightpaths of the optical networks define the topology of the IP network. This new infrastructure has to be sufficiently survivable, so that network services can be restored in the event of a catastrophic failure. In this paper we consider a multilayer survivable network design problem that may be of practical interest for IP-over-optical neworks. We give an integer programming formulation for this problem and discuss the associated polytope. We describe some valid inequalities and study when these are facet defining. We discuss separation algorithms for these inequalities and introduce some reduction operations. We develop a Branch-and-Cut algorithm based on these results and present extensive computational results.",

    "abstract": "This paper presented a grid-based hexahedral element mesh generation algorithm for solid models with concave curved boundary lines. A deep study was focused on the boundary matching and quality improvement techniques. Firstly, a method for computing the curvature values of the triangle facets and sub-surfaces was proposed. In order to improve the surface mesh quality, a layer of new elements was inserted on the surface of the jagged core mesh. Then, a relative position relationship method was used to match C-edges of the solid model. Eight different types of free quadrilateral facet configurations were established. In order to handle the concave curve-matching problem, this paper proposed a method to modify the matching properties of the degenerate quadrilateral facets fitted on the same concave curved boundary line by unifying their orientations to point to the same sub-surface. In addition, six mixed templates were newly proposed to improve the geometrical topology of the degenerate elements associated with concave curves and sharp features. The positions of the nodes were smoothed by the modified Laplacian method and objective function. Finally, the effectiveness and reliability of the algorithms proposed in this paper were demonstrated by a practical example.",

    "abstract": "Existing security research in wireless sensor networks is based on specific assumptions about the nodes and the network environment that are tied to specific usage scenarios. Typical scenarios consider sensor nodes that are immobile and have pre-defined communication patterns. We argue that node mobility is a realistic characteristic of sensor nodes that needs to be taken into consideration in future sensor networks. Mobility capabilities can address the objective challenges raised in mission-critical applications, such as in disaster relief, where their environment characteristics fluctuate over time. It is imperative to investigate the way security is affected in mobile sensor networks and identify the challenges that will need to be addressed in future security protocol design. We present our vision for future sensor networks through a realistic scenario and discuss security gaps that are present in existing research for next generation sensor networks.",

    "abstract": "Traditional component models and frameworks simplified software system development by enabling developers to break software systems into independent pieces with well-defined interfaces. This approach led to looser coupling among the system pieces and enhanced possibilities for reuse. While the component-based approach led to advancements in the software development process, it still has its limitations. In particular, after a component-based application is developed and deployed it typically is a monolithic and static configuration of components.The advent of service-oriented component (SOC), the rise in popularity of consumer devices, and the ubiquity of connectivity have fostered a growing interest in applications that react dynamically to changes in the availability of various services. To simplify the creation of such dynamic software systems, it is possible to borrow concepts from SOC and include them into a component model, resulting in a service-oriented component model that specifically supports dynamically adaptable applications. This paper presents iPOJO, a service-oriented component framework to help developers implement dynamically adaptable software systems.",

    "abstract": "Ecology and resource efficiency have achieved high relevance in industry, not only due to their economic effects. Thus, logistics planning is required to contribute to \"green\" initiatives. However, it still lacks appropriate methods and tools. Simulation represents a well-accepted method in logistics planning, for it can handle dynamics, stochastic effects and a high degree of complexity. In the context of ecological planning, dynamics play an important role as demand peaks are compensated by usually inefficient supporting processes, such as express transportation. OTD-NET is known as an innovative supply chain simulator and is extended by the ecological transportation assessment. This enables the evaluation of green KPIs and -- due to the intra-simulative approach -- logistics decisions based on ecological balances. In this paper we describe the state-of-the-art on ecological assessment, discuss requirements for its integration into simulation, and explain an implementation approach as well as its benefits by means of a use case.",

    "abstract": "Model checking is a promising technique for verifying program behavior and is increasingly finding usage in industry. To date, however, researchers have primarily considered model checking of single versions of programs. It is well understood that model checking can be very expensive for large, complex programs. Thus, simply reapplying model checking techniques on subsequent versions of programs as they evolve, in the limited time that is typically available for validating new releases, presents challenges. To address these challenges, we have developed a new technique for regression model checking (RMC), that applies model checking incrementally to new versions of systems. We report results of an empirical study examining the effectiveness of our technique; our results show that it is significantly faster than traditional model checking.",

The scheme models the causal dependencies between the functionalities of objects and their descriptions, and then employs the maximum expected utility principle, which combines probability theory and logic, to select the most appropriate label for the object. S ince most existing scene interpretation methods rely heavily on training data, we develop in this paper a recursive version of ToK to avoid such dependency. Recursive ToK learns the prior distributions iteratively from the decisi ons of labelling components made in the last iteration, partly by functionaliti es of components, and partly by the already learnt prior distributions in prev ious iterations. To validate our method in the domain of 3D outdoor scene interpretation, we compare ToK against a state-of-the-art method, Expandable Bayesian Networks (EBN), for labelling components of buildings. Experimental results then show that the labelling accuracy of ToK is superior to that of EBN. Also, these results reveal that recursive ToK improves the accuracy of ToK for labelling 3D components in the worst case when lacking any training data.",

    "abstract": "Let \u03c0(x;d,a) denote the number of primes p \u2264 x with p \u2261 a(modd). Chebyshev's bias is the phenomenon for which \"more often\" \u03c0(x; d, n) > \u03c0(x; d, r), than the other way around, where n is a quadratic nonresidue mod d and r is a quadratic residue mod d. If \u03c0(x; d, n) \u2265 \u03c0(x; d, r) for every x up to some large number, then one expects that N(x; d, n) \u2265 N(x; d, r) for every x. Here N(x; d, a) denotes the number of integers n \u2264 x such that every prime divisor p of n satisfies p \u2261 a(mod d). In this paper we develop some tools to deal with this type of problem and apply them to show that, for example, N(x; 4, 3) \u2265 N(x; 4, 1) for every x.In the process we express the so-called second order Landau-Ramanujan constant as an infinite series and show that the same type of formula holds for a much larger class of constants.",

    "abstract": "Abstract   Although most people believe that planners that delay step-ordering decisions as long as possible are more efficient than those that manipulate totally ordered sequences of actions, this intuition has received little formal justification or empirical validation. In this paper we do both, characterizing the types of domains that offer performance differentiation and the features that distinguish the relative overhead of three planning algorithms. As expected, the partial-order (nonlinear) planner often has an advantage when confronted with problems in which the specific order of the plan steps is critical. We argue that the observed performance differences are best understood with an extension of Korf's taxonomy of subgoal collections. Each planner quickly solved problems whose subgoals were independent or trivially serializable, but problems with laboriously serializable or nonserializable subgoals were intractable for all planners. Since different plan representations induce distinct search spaces, the subgoals for a given problem may be trivially serializable for one planner, laboriously serializable for another, and nonserializable for a third. We contend that the partial-order representation yields superior performance because it more frequently results in trivial serializability.",

    "abstract": "In this paper we present, for the first time in Brain-Computer Interface (BCI) research, a novel application for music composition. We developed, based on the I$^2$R NeuroComm BCI platform, a novel Graphical User Interface (GUI) to allow composition of short melodies by selecting individual musical notes. The user can select any individual musical key (quarter note with Do, R\\'{e}, Mi, Fa, Sol, La, Si, Do, etc.), insert a silence (quarter rest), delete (Del) the last note to correct the composition, or listen (Play) to the final melody, shown in text form and as a musical partition. Our BCI system for music composition has been successfully demonstrated and shown to be, with very short training time, effective and easy to use. This work is the first step towards a more intelligent BCI system that will extend current BCI-based Virtual Reality (VR) navigation for e.g. exploring a Virtual Synthesizer Museum/shop, in which the user would first move around within the virtual museum/shop and at the point of interest would try the synthesizer by composing music. More advanced modes (e.g. musical puzzle) with various levels of difficulty will be added in future developments as well as using the Open Vibe environment and mobile platforms such as the Apple's iPAD.",

Discovering the correspondence between accounts of a same individual is a crucial prerequisite for many interesting cross network applications, such as improving the recommendation performance of the online shopping sites by using extra information from social network services. In this paper, we propose a gametheoretic method to identify correlation accounts of individuals between social network sites and online shopping sites with stable matching model, incorporating accounts profiles as well as historical behaviors.

Secondly, it improves the accuracy of the normal method of three times estimation by adopting the restrictive probability to estimate the three times and the minimal deviation model.

    "abstract": "In this paper, we propose an efficient uplink and downlink cooperative transmission and receiving scheme for interleave-division multiple access (IDMA) systems with time-reversal (TR) technique. We refer this system as TDR-IDMA, since the time- division duplexing (TDD) mode is used in this transceiver system. In TDR-IDMA systems, the time-reversed version of the channel impulse responses obtained from the uplink is used to process the received signal before the elementary signal estimator in the receiver of base station (BS). Due to the weak correlations of multi-path for different users, the signal to interference and noise ratio (SINR) at the beginning of turbo-like detection of TDR-IDMA can be increased significantly. Compared with conventional IDMA system, much less iterations is needed for signal detection in TDR-IDMA systems. Thus, the proposed scheme effectively reduces the multi-user detection (MUD) computation load for the uplink, which is the bottleneck for IDMA system. TR processing is also applied in the transmitter of BS to reduce the complexity of user ends (UEs). Simulation and analysis results show that TDR-IDMA can achieve the same performance of the traditional IDMA system with fast processing speed and simple UEs.",

    "abstract": "In this paper, we extend the traditional formalization of distributed constraint satisfaction problems (DisCSP) to a quantified DisCSP. A quantified DisCSP includes several universally quantified variables, while all of the variables in a traditional DisCSP are existentially quantified. A universally quantified variable represents a choice of nature or an adversary. A quantified DisCSP formalizes a situation where a team of agents is trying to make a robust plan against nature or an adversary. In this paper, we present the formalization of such a quantified DisCSP and develop an algorithm for solving it by generalizing the asynchronous backtracking algorithm used for solving a DisCSP. In this algorithm, agents communicate a value assignment called a good in addition to the nogood used in asynchronous backtracking. Interestingly, the procedures executed by an adversarial/cooperative agent for good/nogood are completely symmetrical. Furthermore, we develop a method that improves this basic algorithm. Experimental evaluation results illustrate that we observe an easy-hard-easy transition by changing the tightness of the constraints, while very loose problem instances are relatively hard. The modification of the basic algorithm is also effective and reduces the number of cycles by approximately 25% for the hardest problem instances.",

Such a system upgrading consists first of all in the realization of a multi-antenna system able to carry out, simultaneously, Across-Track (XT) and Along-Track (AT) SAR Interferometry (InSAR). Moreover, the system upgrading is also aimed at improving the performances achievable in repeat-pass applications, such as Differential SAR Interferometry, (DInSAR), which require very precise measurement of the tracks described during the flight by the SAR antennas.",

    "abstract": "We address the problem of content discovery and provision in vehicular networks with infrastructure, when a publish/subscribe paradigm is applied. In the scenario we consider, vehicular users can be providers and consumers of generic information content, which is available through the vehicular network itself. Special infrastructure nodes act as information brokers and aid vehicles in content retrieval and dissemination. We study the performance of such a scheme by evaluating the probability that a content requested by a vehicle can be found and successfully delivered to the querying vehicle. To ensure high success probability, we design a credit-based scheme integrated with a feedback-based mechanism. The combined use of credit and feedback entices rational users to provide their content when requested by other users (thus discouraging free-riding behavior), and guarantees that no user is unduly burdened by too many requests for the same content (thus guaranteeing users a fair treatment). Also, through a banning mechanism that temporarily inhibits service to misbehaving users, we effectively counter malicious users whose sole objective is to disrupt the system. Using a simple game-theoretic formulation, we prove that these mechanisms ensure that cooperation is the best choice for rational users. The performance of our scheme for discovery and provision of content is shown through ns-3 simulations, by using a real-world road topology and realistic vehicular traces",

The impacts of biasing and parasitic capacitance on gain, noise and linearity are investigated and a new gain tuning method is proposed. The proposed wideband LNA is designed in a 0.18 \u00b5m CMOS process. The post-layout simulations show the proposed LNA has a maximum gain of 18 dB and a tunable gain range of 23.1 dB. The LNA shows a noise figure (NF) from 2.16 dB to 2.31 dB at maximum gain mode, a third-order input-referred intercept point (IIP3) of 10.36 dBm and an input referred 1-dB compression point of 1.66 dBm. The return loss S11 is better than \u221211.0 dB in the frequency range from 470 to 870 MHz. The proposed LNA consumes 5.93 mA from a 1.8 V power supply.",

The measurements were taken at 36 distinct transmitter locations around a circle with a radius of 20 meters and a height of 1.2 meters. Both the model and the measurements produced consistent results in which the exterior roof location exhibited low mean and low standard deviation results in comparison with significantly worse results in terms of the mean and standard deviation for the three interior locations.

    "abstract": "Brain regions of human subjects exhibit certain levels of associated activation upon specific environmental stimuli. Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging (fMRI) detects regional signals, based on which we could infer the direct or indirect neuronal connectivity between the regions. Structural Equation Modeling (SEM) is an appropriate mathematical approach for analyzing the effective connectivity using fMRI data. A maximum likelihood (ML) discrepancy function is minimized against some constrained coefficients of a path model. The minimization is an iterative process. The computing time is very long as the number of iterations increases geometrically with the number of path coefficients. Using regular Quad-Core Central Processing Unit (CPU) platform, duration up to 3 months is required for the iterations from 0 to 30 path coefficients. This study demonstrates the application of Graphical Processing Unit (GPU) with the parallel Genetic Algorithm (GA) that replaces the Powell minimization in the standard program code of the analysis software package. It was found in the same example that GA under GPU reduced the duration to 20 h and provided more accurate solution when compared with standard program code under CPU.",

In conventional methods, it is required that the watermark is embedded without noise perception. However, it is difficult to embed the watermark without noise perception. Hence, we propose an embedding method so as to permit a perception of an embedded watermark signal. For watermarked audio signal, high sound quality is needed even if noises are perceived. Therefore, we estimate notes into music data and decide their timbre by musical instrument identification. Furthermore, for improving the sound quality, we embed one bit of watermark into one tone using the corresponding sampled sound for each tone.",

While defining the allocation method of this applications in data streams, data broadcast protocols do not consider the applications' demands as for the download time. Furthermore, applications with strong time restrictions will be damaged, since they do not have priority during the allocation of the applications in the data streams, and they will have a wait time that would represent exorbitant fines according to the current business model. To solve this problem, it were proposed a business model that defines rules to establish the priority of each application and, principally, a scheduling algorithm, based on the GRASP and VND metaheuristics, which aimed to minimize the delay in the execution of applications in a computational reasonable time.",

In this paper, we propose a fully automated approach to compositional reasoning that consists of automated decomposition using a hypergraph partitioning algorithm for balanced clustering of variables, and discovering assumptions using the L * algorithm for active learning of regular languages. We present a symbolic implementation of the learning algorithm, and incorporate it in the model checker NuSmv.

    "abstract": "As more and more electronic clinical information is becoming easier to access for secondary uses such as clinical research, approaches that enable faster and more collaborative research while protecting patient privacy and confidentiality are becoming more important. Clinical text de-identification offers such advantages but is typically a tedious manual process. Automated Natural Language Processing (NLP) methods can alleviate this process, but their impact on subsequent uses of the automatically de-identified clinical narratives has only barely been investigated.#R##N##R##N#In the context of a larger project to develop and investigate automated text de-identification for Veterans Health Administration (VHA) clinical notes, we studied the impact of automated text de-identification on clinical information in a stepwise manner. Our approach started with a high-level assessment of clinical notes informativeness and formatting, and ended with a detailed study of the overlap of select clinical information types and Protected Health Information (PHI). To investigate the informativeness (i.e., document type information, select clinical data types, and interpretation or conclusion) of VHA clinical notes, we used five different existing text de-identification systems. The informativeness was only minimally altered by these systems while formatting was only modified by one system. To examine the impact of de-identification on clinical information extraction, we compared counts of SNOMED-CT concepts found by an open source information extraction application in the original (i.e., not de-identified) version of a corpus of VHA clinical notes, and in the same corpus after de-identification. Only about 1.2\u20133% less SNOMED-CT concepts were found in de-identified versions of our corpus, and many of these concepts were PHI that was erroneously identified as clinical information. To study this impact in more details and assess how generalizable our findings were, we examined the overlap between select clinical information annotated in the 2010 i2b2 NLP challenge corpus and automatic PHI annotations from our best-of-breed VHA clinical text de-identification system (nicknamed \u2018BoB\u2019). Overall, only 0.81% of the clinical information exactly overlapped with PHI, and 1.78% partly overlapped.#R##N##R##N#We conclude that automated text de-identification\u2019s impact on clinical information is small, but not negligible, and that improved clinical acronyms and eponyms disambiguation could significantly reduce this impact.",

    "abstract": "An emerging approach to software development is Model Driven Software Development (MDSD). It shifts the focus from source code to models, aims at cost reduction, risk mitigation, and eases the engineering of complex applications. System models can be used in the early development stages to verify certain relevant properties, such as performance, before source code is available and problems become hard and costly to solve. The present status of Model Driven Engineering (MDE) is still far from this ideal situation. A well-known problem is feedback provisioning, which arises when different solutions for the same design problem exist. An approach for feedback provisioning automation leverages model transformations, which glue together models in an MDSD setting, encapsulate the design rationale, and promote knowledge reuse and solutions otherwise available only to experienced engineers. In this article we present QVTR2, our solution to the feedback problem. QVTR2 is an extension of the QVT-Relations language with constructs to express design alternatives, their impact on non-functional metrics, and how to evaluate them and guide the engineers in the selection of the most appropriate solution. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our solution by using the QVTR2 engine to perform a modified version of the standard UML-to-RDBMS transformation in the context of a real e-commerce application, and by showing how we can guide a non-expert engineer in the selection of a solution that satisfies given performance requirements.",

The proposed methods consider the parametric estimation of reliability parameters.",

    "abstract": "This paper gives a replica analysis for the minimum mean square error (MSE) of a massive multiple-input multipleoutput (MIMO) system by using Bayesian inference. The Bayesoptimal estimator is adopted to estimate the data symbols and the channels from a block of received signals in the spatial-temporal domain. We show that using the Bayes-optimal estimator, the interfering signals from adjacent cells can be separated from the received signals without pilot information of the interfering signals. In addition, the MSEs with respect to the data symbols and the channels of the desired users decrease with the number of receive antennas and the number of data symbols, respectively. There are no residual interference terms that remain bounded away from zero as the numbers of receive antennas and data symbols approach infinity.",

    "abstract": "We explore an approach to full-body motion editing with linear motion models, prioritized constraint-based optimization and latent-space interpolation. By exploiting the mathematical connections between linear motion models and prioritized inverse kinematics (PIK), we formulate and solve the motion editing problem as an optimization function whose differential structure is rich enough to efficiently optimize user-specified constraints within the latent motion space. Performing motion editing within latent motion spaces has the advantage of handling pose transitions and consequently motion flow by construction from single key-frame editing. To handle motion adjustments from multiple key-frame and trajectory constraints, we developed a latent-space interpolation technique by exploiting spline functions. Such an approach handles per-frame adjustments generating smooth animations, while avoiding the computational expense of joint space interpolations. We demonstrate the usefulness of this approach by editing and generating full-body reaching and walking jump animations in challenging environment scenarios.",

Vibration control for these systems often focuses on restricting the response resulting from external disturbances (e.g. support roller eccentricity or aerodynamic excitation) to areas not requiring high precision positioning. This paper introduces vibration controllers for an axially moving string system consisting of a controlled span coupled to a disturbed span via an actuator. The system model includes a partial differential equation for the two spans and an ordinary differential equation for the actuator. Exact model knowledge and adaptive isolation controllers, based on Lyapunov theory, regulate the controlled span from bounded disturbances in the adjacent, uncontrolled span. Assuming distributed damping in the uncontrolled span, the exact model knowledge and adaptive controllers exponentially and asymptotically drive the controlled span displacement to zero, respectively, while ensuring bounded uncontrolled span displacement and control force. Experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed controller in isolating the controlled span from disturbances and damping the controlled span displacement.",

Due to the interaction of discrete and continuous dynamics, failures to detect such events may have catastrophic impacts on the global simulation. Current methods employ numeric algorithms/solvers for the underlying systems of differential equations, and therefore inherently suffer from the accumulation of numeric inaccuracies. In this paper, we propose a method for simulation of hybrid systems that is based on a combination of symbolic and numeric computations, which allows one to predict discrete events without accumulating numeric inaccuracies during the continuous evolution.

This control law which stabilizes globally the attitude of the system for all the equilibrium points, is parameterized by quaternions. First, for the kinematic subsystem, we design a virtual optimal angular velocity. To obtain the global minimum of the performance index, this optimal angular velocity is only discontinuous in initial values. It can be regarded as a combination of open loop control and closed loop control. Then for the dynamic subsystem, we design a optimal control that can force the angular velocity to track the virtual optimal angular velocity. Thus, we design a control that is more natural and efficient use of energy, fact that states converge to the nearest equilibrium.

During each stage, the classification is dynamically optimized to discriminate a set of promising candidates selected from the previous stage, thereby incrementally increasing the overall discriminating performance. To ensure improved performance, the base classifier at each stage should satisfy two key properties: (1) adaptivity to specific populations, and (2) high training and identification efficiency such that dynamic training can be performed for each test case. To this end, we adopt a base classifier with (1) dynamic person-specific feature selection, and (2) voting of an ensemble of simple classifiers based on selected features. Our experiments show that the cascaded framework effectively improves the face recognition rate by up to 5% compared to a single stage algorithm, and it is 2-3% better than established well-known face recognition algorithms.",

Techniques such as batching, patching, periodic broadcasting, chaining, and piggybacking have been explored both in isolation and in combinations. This study investigates a new tool in the arsenal-channel folding, where aggressive client-side caching is used to merge clients from one multicast channel into the other. In particular, this channel folding algorithm is applied to a previously proposed unified video-on-demand (UVoD)) architecture to demonstrate and to quantify its impact on the performance and the tradeoff in a multicast video distribution architecture. This paper presents this channel folding algorithm in the context of UVoD) and derives a performance model to obtain the system latency, the near-optimal channel partition policy, and the client buffer requirement. Numerical results show that channel folding can double the capacity of UVoD) with a remarkably small overhead in the client buffer requirement.",

    "abstract": "This paper presents a novel method for recovering signaling pathways from protein-protein interaction networks automatically. Given an undirected weighted protein interaction network, finding signaling pathways is treated as searching for the optimal subnetworks from the network according to some cost function. To approach this optimum problem, an integer linear programming model is proposed in this work to model the signal pathways from the protein interaction network. The numerical results on three known yeast MAPK signal pathways demonstrate the effic iency and effectiveness of the proposed method.",

    "abstract": "Pattern-matching is a fundamental feature in many applications such as functional programming, logic programming, theorem proving, term rewriting and rule-based expert systems. Usually, patterns are pre-processed into a deterministic finite automaton. Using such an automaton allows one to determine the matched pattern(s) by a single scan of the input term. The matching automaton is typically based on left-to-right traversal of patterns. With ambiguous patterns a subject term may be an instance of more than one pattern. To select the pattern to use, a priority rule is usually engaged. The pre-processing of the patterns adds new patterns which are instances of the original ones. When the original patterns are ambiguous, some of the instances supplied may be irrelevant for the matching process. They may cause an unnecessary increase in the space requirements of the automaton and may also reduce the time efficiency of the matching process. Here, we devise a new pre-processing operation that recognises and avoids such irrelevant instances and hence improves space and time requirements for the matching automaton.",

The device is designed to function as a 2D vector accelerator, as is required for many image coding/processing/vision tasks. The device (DIP chip) is not specific to any one image algorithm, and can be regarded as a general purpose processor. It has variable bit accuracy, variable kernel size and a high input/output bandwidth (greater than 1.2 billion bits per second), and is designed to perform a wide variety of mathematical functions, especially 2D accumulation. >",

    "abstract": "Processing of images in the transform domain saves computation by avoiding inverse and re-transform operations. In this paper, we present a technique for filtering of images in the transform domain using symmetric convolution in the block DCT space. Due to the application of convolution-multiplication property in the DCT domain, the filtering operation requires significantly less computation than its equivalent in the original signal/image space. To take care of discontinuities along boundaries of blocks, filtering is performed on a larger DCT block composed from adjacent blocks. Subsequently, the filtered DCT block is obtained by decomposing it. The proposed filtering technique achieves the same results of linear convolution in the spatial domain with reduced cost. With the proposed filtering, it is possible to significantly speedup the operation by ignoring some elements in the filtering matrices whose magnitudes are smaller than a threshold value. Typical sparseness of DCT domain input blocks is also considered for further reduction of computational cost. The proposed method uses simple linear operations such as matrix multiplication, which is appropriate for efficient hardware implementations. We also demonstrate its applications in image sharpening and removal of blocking artifacts directly in the compressed domain.",

The alteration of shape is implemented in a hardware prototype using a dynamic knob as an interaction device for the user. The knob alters the phone's shape according to different events and states, like incoming calls, new voice mail, or missed calls. Therefore, the user can explore the phone's status by touching it -- ambiently, even through the pocket. Initial user testing showed that this form of tactile interaction was easy to understand and handy to interact with, also for unexperienced users.",

The estimation procedure is based on the assumption of the so- called Oriented Volume over Ground model for the scene. Unfor- tunately, this model leads to a nonlinear formulation that must be inverted. In addition, the inverse problem is indeterminate, since there are more unknowns than input data. In this paper, two strategies used to solve this problem are described. The first one is based on a combination of a geometrical approach (a line fit on the complex plane) and a subsequent numerical method implemented with a genetic algorithm. The second technique extends the observation space by using data from two different baselines. The discussion about these methods is illustrated with indoor data from corn and rice crops.",

The term \"reference structure\" was firstly proposed in computational imaging systems. Thus, this review firstly introduces computational imaging systems from the view of a mathematical framework. Then the significance of reference structure in imaging systems is presented in the mathematical way. After the review of the functionality of reference structure, the applications using reference structures in sensor systems are summarized. We discuss the applications of segmenting object space by reference structure. Thus, some investigations on segmenting object space by geometric reference structure are reviewed because the analysis of segmenting object space is crucial to the design of a sensor system.",

    "abstract": "This paper proposes an improved optical flow estimation ap- proach based on the total variational L1 minimization technique with weighted median filter. Furthermore, recovering image details using mod- ified census transform algorithm improves the overall accuracy of esti- mating large scale displacements optical flow. On the other hand, the use of the Taylor expansion approximation in most of the optical flow ap- proaches limits the ability to estimate movement of fast objects. Hence, a coarse-to-fine scheme is used to overcome such a problem of the cost of losing small details in the interpolation process where initial values are propagated from the coarse level to the fine one. The proposed algorithm improves the accuracy of the estimation process by integrating the corre- spondence results of the modified census transform into the coarse-to-fine module in order to recover the lost details. The outcome of the proposed approach yields state-of-the-art results on the Middlebury optical flow evaluations.",

The usefulness of open plugins to collect resources from the cloud in such dedicated contextual spaces is discussed. The mechanisms for the personalization of spaces from an interaction point of view once populated with resources and their sharing across platforms are also detailed.

    "abstract": "Optical packet/burst switching is considered a promising technique to improve the performance of optical networks. Key components in these technologies are the optical switching nodes. Some of these node architectures suffer from internal blocking. Synchronous operation allows overcoming most of the problems introduced by this internal blocking. However, in asynchronous networks internal blocking can have a more pronounced effect. In this paper, we propose a windowing technique to improve the performance of internally blocking optical switching nodes in asynchronous operation. Simulations will show significant improvements can be made.",

And they provided a formal proof of security to show its strength against both passive and active adversaries. Compared with the previous well-known protocols, SAKA has less number of steps and less computation cost. However, considering the total execution time, SAKA is not the most efficient method, since it does not provide parties with parallel computation. In this paper, we present parallelizable simple authenticated key agreement protocol for improving the efficiency of the SAKA while maintaining provable security.",

    "abstract": "Multi-class Object Methodology allows objects to change their structure and behavior with respect to semantic integrity. This paper examines the problem of object constraint satisfaction. Two aspects of object constraints are analyzed in detail. The first aspect refers to multi-class feature of objects, and the second is related to the migration of multi-class objects. The expanding approach compared to existing solutions is relied on standardizing the elementary notions: object and constraint. The major contribution is: objects are allowed to change during their lifetime and migrate between systems, also constraints are allowed to change and migrate. The sequence of migration is depending on operation order.",

    "abstract": "Audio signal classification consists of extracting some descriptive features from a sound and use them as input in a classifier. Then, the classifier will assign a different label to any different sound class. The classification of the features can be performed in a supervised or unsupervised way. However, unsupervised classification usually supposes a challenge against supervised classification as it has to be performed without any a priori knowledge. In this paper, unsupervised classification of audio signals is accomplished by using a Probabilistic Self-Organizing Map (PSOM) with probabilistic labeling. The hybrid unsupervised classifier presented in this work can achieve higher detection rates than the reached by the unsupervised traditional SOM. Moreover, real audio recordings from clarinet music are used to show the performance of our proposal.",

    "abstract": "This paper introduces a probabilistic rebound Turing machine (PRTM), and investigates the fundamental property of the machine. We first prove a sublogarithmic lower space bound on the space complexity of this model with bounded errors for recognizing specific languages. This lower bound strengthens a previous lower bound for conventional probabilistic Turing machines with bounded errors. We then show, by using our lower space bound and an idea in the proof of it, that i) [PRTM(o(logn))] is incomparable with the class of context-free languages, ii) there is a language accepted by a two-way deterministic one counter automaton, but not in [PRTM(o(logn))], and where [PRTM(o(logn))] denotes the class of languages recognized by o(logn) space-bounded PRTMs with error probability less than . Furthermore, we show that there is an infinite space hierarchy for [PRTM(o(logn))]. We finally show that [PRTM(o(logn))] is not closed under concatenation, Kleene +, and length-preserving homomorphism. This paper answers two open problems in a previous paper.",

    "abstract": "We study the stability properties of nonlinear multi-task regression in reproducing Hilbert spaces with operator-valued kernels. Such kernels, a.k.a. multi-task kernels, are appropriate for learning prob- lems with nonscalar outputs like multi-task learning and structured out- put prediction. We show that multi-task kernel regression algorithms are uniformly stable in the general case of infinite-dimensional output spaces. We then derive under mild assumption on the kernel generaliza- tion bounds of such algorithms, and we show their consistency even with non Hilbert-Schmidt operator-valued kernels . We demonstrate how to apply the results to various multi-task kernel regression methods such as vector-valued SVR and functional ridge regression.",

    "abstract": "This paper describes an original approach for structuring video documents into scenes by grouping video shots. The method is based on the construction of 1D mosaics. 1D mosaics are built based on X-ray projections of color video frames representing integration along vertical and horizontal axes. The mosaicing is realized by motion compensation in a 1D domain. Grouping of shots in a scene is done by local and global matching of mosaics, based on piecewise linear approximation and hierarchical clustering. The results obtained on feature documentaries are promising.",

    "abstract": "Seawater salinity measurements are currently being made at L-band (1.413 Ghz) by NASA's Aquarius instrument (on the Aquarius/SAC-D observatory). The goal of Aquarius mission is to measure the salinity of seawater to an accuracy on the order of 0.2 psu; this requires a model function of seawater permittivity with a high accuracy. Since 2011, the George Washington University (GW) has employed a cavity technique to determine the complex permittivity of seawater at 1.413 GHz. In this paper, a new seawater dielectric model function is introduced including the latest permittivity data for seawater with salinity 33 psu. Finally, the validation of the end-effect, measurement variance and data fitting will be discussed.",

    "abstract": "High-throughput P2P streaming relies on peer selection, the strategy a peer uses to select other peer(s) as its parent(s) of streaming. Although this problem has been thoroughly investigated in the classical optimization framework under static settings, it still remains unaddressed as how to sustain throughput competitive to the optimum under highly dynamic peer churning. To accommodate such peer dynamics, we extend the classical optimization framework and propose a distributed online peer selection algorithm. This basic algorithm is further extended to a variety of settings commonly seen in operational P2P networks, such as multi-parent streaming, admission control, delay constraint, etc. We prove approximation bound of our algorithm to the optimal throughput. Through evaluation under different topological setups and peer churning sequences, we show that our solution can consistently deliver competitive throughput, which greatly outperforms its theoretical bound.",

    "abstract": "Millimeter wave (mmW) bands between 30 and 300 GHz have attracted considerable attention for nextgeneration cellular networks due to vast quantities of available spectrum and the possibility of very high-dimensional antenna arrays. However, a key issue in these systems is range: mmW signals are extremely vulnerable to shadowing and poor high-frequency propagation. Multi-hop relaying is therefore a natural technology for such systems to improve cell range and cell edge rates without the addition of wired access points. This paper studies the problem of scheduling for a simple infrastructure cellular relay system where communication between wired base stations and User Equipment follow a hierarchical tree structure through fixed relay nodes. Such a systems builds naturally on existing cellular mmW backhaul by adding mmW in the access links. A key feature of the proposed system is that TDD duplexing selections can be made on a link-by-link basis due to directional isolation from other links. We devise an efficient, greedy algorithm for centralized scheduling that maximizes network utility by jointly optimizing the duplexing schedule and resources allocation for dense, relay-enhanced OFDMA/TDD mmW networks. The proposed algorithm can dynamically adapt to loading, channel conditions and traffic demands. Significant throughput gains and improved resource utilization offered by our algorithm over the static, globally-synchronized TDD patterns are demonstrated through simulations based on empirically-derived channel models at 28 GHz.",

In this paper, we focus on 3 monetization axes: community management, personalized advertising, and recommendation.

    "abstract": "Multiobjective evolutionary algorithm based on decomposition (MOEA/D) has attracted a great deal of attention and has obtained enormous success in the field of evolutionary multiobjective optimization. It converts a multiobjective optimization problem (MOP) into a set of scalar optimization subproblems and then uses the evolutionary algorithm (EA) to optimize these subproblems simultaneously. However, there is a great deal of randomness in MOEA/D. Researchers in the field of evolutionary algorithm, reinforcement learning and neural network have reported that the simultaneous consideration of randomness and opposition has an advantage over pure randomness. A new scheme, called opposition-based learning (OBL), has been proposed in the machine learning field. In this paper, OBL has been integrated into the framework of MOEA/D to accelerate its convergence speed. Hence, our proposed approach is called opposition-based learning MOEA/D (MOEA/D-OBL). Compared with MOEA/D, MOEA/D-OBL uses an opposition-based initial population and opposition-based learning strategy to generate offspring during the evolutionary process. It is compared with its parent algorithm MOEA/D on four representative kinds of MOPs and many-objective optimization problems. Experimental results indicate that MOEA/D-OBL outperforms or performs similar to MOEA/D. Moreover, the parameter sensitivity of generalization opposite point and the probable to use OBL is experimentally investigated.",

    "abstract": "Oil spill detection using SAR imagery is well established and currently used operationally over European waters. However, adaptation of oil spill detection methodologies exploiting polarimetric features is still in research phase and until recently those properties have not been used for operational services. Proposed methodology introduces for the first time a combination of traditional and polarimetric features for object-based oil spill detection and look-alike discrimination in a Near Real Time environment. A total number of 35 feature parameters were extracted from 225 oil spill and 26 look-alikes and divided into training and validation dataset. Extracted features have been assessed and ranked according to their ability to discriminate between oil spill and \u2018look-alike\u2019. Extracted features are used for training and validation of a Support Vector Machine based classifier. Performance estimation was carried out for the proposed methodology on a large dataset with overall classification accuracy of 90% oil spill and 91% for look-alike. Polarimetric features such as Geometric Intensity, Co-Polarization Power Ratio, Span proven to be more discriminative than other polarimetric and traditional features.",

    "abstract": "In general, software reliability models have focused on modeling and predicting the failure detection process and have not given equal priority to modeling the fault correction process. However, it is important to address the fault correction process in order to identify the need for process improvements. Process improvements, in turn, will contribute to achieving software reliability goals. We introduce the concept of a fault correction profile \" a set of functions that predict fault correction events as a function of failure detection events. The fault correction profile identifies the need for process improvements and provides information for developing fault correction strategies. Related to the fault correction profile is the goal fault correction profile. This profile represents the fault correction goal against which the achieved fault correction profile can be compared. This comparison motivates the concept of fault correction process instability, and the attributes of instability. Applying these concepts to the NASA Goddard Space Flight Center fault correction process and its data, we demonstrate that the need for process improvement can be identified, and that improvements in process would contribute to meeting product reliability goals.",

    "abstract": "Researchers have proposed several data and computation transformations to improve locality in irregular scientific codes. We experimentally compare their performance and present GPART, a new technique based on hierarchical clustering. Quality partitions are constructed quickly by clustering multiple neighboring nodes with priority on nodes with high degree, and repeating a few passes. Overhead is kept low by clustering multiple nodes in each pass and considering only edges between partitions. Experimental results show GPART matches the performance of more sophisticated partitioning algorithms to with 6%-8%, with a small fraction of the overhead. It is thus useful for optimizing programs whose running times are not known.",

    "abstract": "This paper investigates two methods of improving the user experience of camera-based interaction. First, problems that arise when avatars are designed to mimic a user's physical actions are presented. Second, a solution is proposed: adding a layer of separation between user and avatar while retaining intuitive user control. Two methods are proposed for this separation: spatially and temporally. Implementations of these methods are then presented in the context of a simple game and evaluate their effect on performance and satisfaction. Results of a human subject experiment are presented, showing that reducing the amount of user control can maintain, and even improve, user satisfaction if the design of such a reduction is appropriate. This is followed by a discussion of how the findings inform camera-based game design.",

    "abstract": "Job scheduling for a MapReduce cluster has been an active research topic in recent years. However, measurement traces from real-world production environment show that the duration of tasks within a job vary widely. The overall elapsed time of a job, i.e. The so-called flow time, is often dictated by one or few slowly-running tasks within a job, generally referred as the \"stragglers\". The cause of stragglers include tasks running on partially/intermittently failing machines or the existence of some localized resource bottleneck(s) within a MapReduce cluster. To tackle this online job scheduling challenge, we adopt the task cloning approach and design the corresponding scheduling algorithms which aim at minimizing the weighted sum of job flow times in a MapReduce cluster based on the Shortest Remaining Processing Time scheduler (SRPT). To be more specific, we first design a 2-competitive offline algorithm when the variance of task-duration is negligible. We then extend this offline algorithm to yield the so-called SRPTMS+C algorithm for the online case and show that SRPTMS+C is (1+a#x220A;) -- speed o(1/a#x220A;2) -- competitive in reducing the weighted sum of job flow times within a cluster. Both of the algorithms explicitly consider the precedence constraints between the two phases within the MapReduce framework. We also demonstrate via trace-driven simulations that SRPTMS+C can significantly reduce the weighted/unweighted sum of job flow times by cutting down the elapsed time of small jobs substantially. In particular, SRPTMS+C beats the Microsoft Mantri scheme by nearly 25% according to this metric.",

    "abstract": "The growing popularity of Machine-to-Machine (M2M) communications in cellular networks is driving the need to optimize networks based on the characteristics of M2M, which are significantly different from the requirements that current networks are designed to meet. First, M2M requires large number of short sessions as opposed to small number of long lived sessions required by the human generated traffic. Second, M2M constitutes a number of battery operated devices that are static in locations such as basements and tunnels, and need to transmit at elevated powers compared to the traditional devices. Third, replacing or recharging batteries of such devices may not be feasible. All these differences highlight the importance of a systematic framework to study the power and energy optimal system design in the regime of interest for M2M, which is the main focus of this paper. For a variety of coordinated and uncoordinated transmission strategies, we derive results for the optimal transmit power, energy per bit, and the maximum load supported by the base station, leading to the following design guidelines: (i) frequency division multiple access (FDMA), including equal bandwidth allocation, is sum-power optimal in the asymptotically low spectral efficiency regime, (ii) while FDMA is the best practical strategy overall, uncoordinated code division multiple access (CDMA) is almost as good when the base station is lightly loaded, (iii) the value of optimization within FDMA is not significant in the regime of interest for M2M.",

    "abstract": "A novel framework for consensus clustering is presented which has the ability to determine both the number of clusters and a final solution using multiple algorithms. A consensus similarity matrix is formed from an ensemble using multiple algorithms and several values for k. A variety of dimension reduction techniques and clustering algorithms are considered for analysis. For noisy or high-dimensional data, an iterative technique is presented to refine this consensus matrix in way that encourages algorithms to agree upon a common solution. We utilize the theory of nearly uncoupled Markov chains to determine the number, k , of clusters in a dataset by considering a random walk on the graph defined by the consensus matrix. The eigenvalues of the associated transition probability matrix are used to determine the number of clusters. This method succeeds at determining the number of clusters in many datasets where previous methods fail. On every considered dataset, our consensus method provides a final result with accuracy well above the average of the individual algorithms.",

    "abstract": "It is well known that WiMAX is a broadband technology that is capable of delivering triple play (voice, data, and video) services. However, mobility in WiMAX system is still a main issue when the mobile station (MS) moves across the base station (BS) coverage and be handed over between BSs. Among the challenging issues in mobile WiMAX handover are unnecessary handover, handover failure and handover delay, which may affect real-time applications. The conventional handover decision algorithm in mobile WiMAX is based on a single criterion, which usually uses the received signal strength indicator (RSSI) as an indicator, with the other fixed handover parameters such as handover threshold and handover margin. In this paper, a fuzzy logic based self-adaptive handover (FuzSAHO) algorithm is introduced. The proposed algorithm is derived from the self-adaptive handover parameters to overcome the mobile WiMAX ping-pong handover and handover delay issues. Hence, the proposed FuzSAHO is initiated to check whether a handover is necessary or not which depends on its fuzzy logic stage. The proposed FuzSAHO algorithm will first self-adapt the handover parameters based on a set of multiple criteria, which includes the RSSI and MS velocity. Then the handover decision will be executed according to the handover parameter values. Simulation results show that the proposed FuzSAHO algorithm reduces the number of ping-pong handover and its delay. When compared with RSSI based handover algorithm and mobility improved handover (MIHO) algorithm, respectively, FuzSAHO reduces the number of handovers by 12.5 and 7.5 %, respectively, when the MS velocity is <17 m/s. In term of handover delay, the proposed FuzSAHO algorithm shows an improvement of 27.8 and 8 % as compared to both conventional and MIHO algorithms, respectively. Thus, the proposed multi-criteria with fuzzy logic based self-adaptive handover algorithm called FuzSAHO, outperforms both conventional and MIHO handover algorithms.",

However, this multi-tier architecture along with stringent latency requirements in 5G brings new challenges in security provisioning due to the potential frequent handovers and authentications in 5G small cells and HetNets. In this article, we review related studies and introduce SDN into 5G as a platform to enable efficient authentication hand-over and privacy protection. Our objective is to simplify authentication handover by global management of 5G HetNets through sharing of userdependent security context information among related access points. We demonstrate that SDN-enabled security solutions are highly efficient through its centralized control capability, which is essential for delay-constrained 5G communications.",

This visualization design was directly targeted at supporting tasks identified by the domain experts. This was the need for the ability to provide rapid and immediate assessment of the state of the network and associated hosts. This visualization technique, the Cyber Command Gauge Cluster (CCGC), allows analysts to review the state of the network and locate potentially problematic anomalies, drill down into those anomalies, and prioritize the anomalies for detailed analysis and remediation. By providing a summary representation combined with independent representations of critical parameters, the technique is unique in its ability to aid decision makers in making rapid assessments and prioritization of identified anomalies. While the prototype focuses on network analysis, the technique is devised to provide generalized support for situational awareness in any domain. The generalized parameter mapping allows the technique to be applicable to any level of decision making, from the front-line network analyst to the CIO.",

    "abstract": "Communication is responsible for the majority of energy consumption in typical wireless sensor networks WSNs. While transmission energy can be controlled at each node, reception energy is outside the control of the nodes because they usually do not know the arrival time of their packets and they cannot avoid overhearing packets directed to the other nodes in range. Energy-aware MAC protocols apply duty-cycling which keeps the radio module off for most of the time and wakes it up periodically, but they suffer from overhearing which has been addressed so far either by means of preambles or by means of separate wake-up channels. This paper proposes a complementary approach which exploits the hardware frame filtering capabilities provided by state-of-the-art radio transceivers. Extensive experiments performed on VirtualSense motes show that hardware frame filtering saves more than 50% of the energy spent in the reception of non-intended packets.",

    "abstract": "Recently as efficient processing of aggregate queries for fetching desired data from sensors has been recognized as a crucial part, in-network aggregate query processing techniques are studied intensively in wireless sensor networks. Existing representative in-network aggregate query processing techniques propose routing algorithms and data structures for processing aggregate queries. However, these aggregate query processing techniques have problems such as high energy consumption in sensor nodes, low accuracy of query processing results, and long query processing time. In order to solve these problems and to enhance the efficiency of aggregate query processing in wireless sensor networks, this paper proposes Bucket-based Parallel Aggregation (BPA). BPA divides a query region into several cells according to the distribution of sensor nodes and builds a quadtree, and then processes aggregate queries in parallel for each cell region according to routing. It sends data in duplicate by removing redundant data, which, in turn, enhances the accuracy of query processing results. Also, BPA uses a bucket-based data structure in aggregate query processing, and divides and conquers the bucket data structure adaptively according to the number of data in the bucket. In addition, BPA compresses data in order to reduce the size of data in the bucket and performs data transmission filtering when each sensor node sends data. Finally, in this paper, we prove its superiority through various experiments using sensor data.",

    "abstract": "Mobile devices are gradually taking over traditional computers' dominance in human lives. With the ever-increasing shipment of mobile apps running on these devices, their quality issues become a severe challenge. Although automated testing techniques are being widely studied, they mostly fall short of handling mobile apps' complex interactions, e.g., A finger swipe or device shaking gesture, leading to inadequate testing. In this paper, we present a novel User Guided Automation (UGA) technique to address testing challenges incurred by such complex interactions. UGA exploits user insights to complement automated testing techniques by recording user-guided app executions, replaying apps to certain stop points, and systematically exploring state space from these stop points. We implemented our work as a prototype UGA tool on Android platform and evaluated it on seven real-world Android apps. Evaluation results show that UGA achieved 1.59-21.78\u00d7 improvement in terms of method coverage over state-of-the-art automated techniques in testing mobile apps.",

    "abstract": "To implement green product design, many companies today utilize the product-line strategy to develop environment-friendly products for customers with different willingness-to-pay for the environmental attributes of a product. One major challenge in designing green products is how to deal with the engineering tradeoff between the traditional and environmental attributes along the technology efficient frontier. In this paper, we conceptualize the technology efficient frontier in green product design, and perform theoretical and empirical analyses on the design decisions under different functional forms of efficient frontiers. We develop an analytical framework for identifying the optimal designs under general forms of efficient frontiers, and propose a novel use of trigonometric functions to analyze the design decisions under the linear, concave, and convex efficient frontiers. Additionally, we analyze the average environmental qualities under different efficient frontiers and show that switching between different product-line strategies allows a firm to achieve higher average environmental quality as an alternative to pushing the efficient frontier outward through technology advancement. Moreover, we conduct empirical tests to demonstrate how to empirically identify an efficient frontier and estimate key model parameters. Our analytical results provide new insights for decision makers to manage and regulate green product design with engineering tradeoffs.",

    "abstract": "A cost effective approach to regression testing is to prioritize test cases from a previous version of a software system for the current release. We have previously introduced a new approach for test case prioritization using Bayesian Networks (BN) which integrates different types of information to estimate the probability of each test case finding bugs. In this paper, we enhance our BN-based approach in two ways. First, we introduce a feedback mechanism and a new change information gathering strategy. Second, a comprehensive empirical study is performed to evaluate the performance of the approach and to identify the effects of using different parameters included in the technique. The study is performed on five open source Java objects. The obtained results show relative advantage of using feedback mechanism for some objects in terms of early fault detection. They also provide insight into costs and benefits of the various parameters used in the approach.",

    "abstract": "An important and so far much neglected operative problem in Swedish forestry is to extract round wood from actual harvest areas to load points at forest roads. Once at the load point, logging trucks can collect it for further secondary transportation to saw- and pulp-mills. We report on a system being developed which collects geographic information by a global positioning system (GPS) about log piles and actual routing network used by the forwarder. This is stored together with related information in a geographical information system (GIS). Using operations research (OR) techniques we can find high quality routes. This provides the driver with an operative tool in finding routes. We give numerical results from a case study done for a major Swedish forest company.",

The book begins with a presentation of the basic theory, equations, and data models of narrowband arrays. It then discusses basic beamforming methods and describes how they relate to DOA estimation. Several of the most common classical and subspace-based direction of arrival methods are discussed. The book concludes with an introduction to subspace tracking and shows how subspace tracking algorithms can be used to form an adaptive DOA estimator. Simulation software and additional bibliography are given at the end of the book.Table of Contents: Introduction / Background on Array Processing / Nonadaptive Direction of Arrival Estimation / Adaptive Direction of Arrival Estimation / Appendix",

    "abstract": "The modern trend in Operations Research methodology deserves modelling of all relevant vague or uncertain information involved in a real decision problem. Generally, vagueness is modelled by a fuzzy approach and uncertainty by a stochastic approach. In some cases, a decision maker may prefer using interval numbers as coefficients of an inexact relationship. As a coefficient an interval assumes an extent of tolerance or a region that the parameter can possibly take. However, its use in the optimization problems is not much attended as it merits.#R##N##R##N#This paper defines an interval linear programming problem as an extension of the classical linear programming problem to an inexact environment. On the basis of a comparative study on ordering interval numbers, inequality constraints involving interval coefficients are reduced in their satisfactory crisp equivalent forms and a satisfactory solution of the problem is defined.

    "abstract": "Cameras face a fundamental trade-off between spatial and temporal resolution. Digital still cameras can capture images with high spatial resolution, but most high-speed video cameras have relatively low spatial resolution. It is hard to overcome this trade-off without incurring a significant increase in hardware costs. In this paper, we propose techniques for sampling, representing, and reconstructing the space-time volume to overcome this trade-off. Our approach has two important distinctions compared to previous works: 1) We achieve sparse representation of videos by learning an overcomplete dictionary on video patches, and 2) we adhere to practical hardware constraints on sampling schemes imposed by architectures of current image sensors, which means that our sampling function can be implemented on CMOS image sensors with modified control units in the future. We evaluate components of our approach, sampling function and sparse representation, by comparing them to several existing approaches. We also implement a prototype imaging system with pixel-wise coded exposure control using a liquid crystal on silicon device. System characteristics such as field of view and modulation transfer function are evaluated for our imaging system. Both simulations and experiments on a wide range of scenes show that our method can effectively reconstruct a video from a single coded image while maintaining high spatial resolution.",

    "abstract": "A heterogeneous computing system (HCS) efficiently utilizes the heterogeneity of diverse computational resources interconnected with high speed networks to execute a group of compute intensive tasks. These are typically represented by means of a directed acyclic graph (DAG) with varied computational requirements and constraints. The optimal scheduling of the given set of precedence-constrained tasks to available resources is a core concern in HCS and is known to be NP-complete problem. Task prioritization has been a major criterion for achieving high performance in HCS. This paper presents a SD-Based Algorithm for Task Scheduling (SDBATS) which uses the standard deviation of the expected execution time of a given task on the available resources in the heterogeneous computing environment as a key attribute for assigning task priority. This new approach takes into account the task heterogeneity and achieves a significant reduction in the overall execution time of a given application. The performance of the proposed algorithm has been extensively studied under a variety of conditions on standard task graphs from Graph Partition Archive as well as on some real world application DAGs such as Gaussian Elimination and Fast Fourier Transformation application DAGs. Our results show that SDBATS outperforms well known existing DAG scheduling algorithms in terms of schedule length (make span) and speedup.",

    "abstract": "RF Built-in-Self-Test requires generation and analysis of high frequency signals on-chip, which usually involves complex circuitry. Generally a high frequency to low frequency conversion, such as a peak or amplitude detector, is employed to analyze the output of the device under test (DUT). However, this conversion circuit is subject to similar process variations as the DUT, which has to be included in the measurement process. Moreover, despite affecting the accuracy of the entire measurement, the input generation for RF BIST is sparsely discussed. While relative measurements, such as gain, can be made without knowing the input signal attributes, other parameters, such as output power, IIP3, or IIP5 require absolute measurements, hence the knowledge of the input signal amplitude. In this paper, we propose a technique for on-chip amplitude measurement that is independent of process variations. The approach relies on on-chip generation of a square wave using an RF limiter with two different amplitudes. Using these two input signals and mathematical modeling, we extract the amplitude at the output of the DUT with high accuracy. The circuits for the BIST have been designed and simulated at the transistor level, including process variations. The concept of the proposed measurement technique is demonstrated in hardware using off-the-shelf components.",

There are two key issues for a trust management system: how to design high-level policy language and how to solve the compliance-checking problem [3,4]. We adopt this approach to deal with distributed authorization with delegation. In this paper, we propose an authorization language${\\cal AL}$, a human-understandable high level language to specify various authorization policies. Language ${\\cal AL}$ has rich expressive power which can not only specify delegation, and threshold structures addressed in previous approaches, but also represent structured resources and privileges, positive and negative authorizations, separation of duty, incomplete information reasoning and partial authorization and delegation. We define the semantics of ${\\cal AL}$ through logic programming with answer set semantics and through an authorization scenario we demonstrate the application of language ${\\cal AL}$ .",

    "abstract": "The workflow paradigm is a well established approach to deal with application complexity by supporting the application development by composition of multiple activities. Furthermore workflows allow encapsulating parts of a problem inside an activity that can be reused in different workflow application scenarios for instance long-running experiments such as the ones involving data streaming. These workflows are characterized by multiple, eventually infinite, iterations processing datasets in multiple activities according to the workflow graph. Some of these activities can invoke Cloud services often unreliably or with limitations on quality of service provoking faults. After a fault the most common approach requires restarting of the entire workflow which can lead to a waste of execution time due to unnecessarily repeating of computations. This paper discuss how the AWARD (Autonomic Workflow Activities Reconfigurable and Dynamic) framework supports recovery from activity faults using dynamic reconfigurations. This is illustrated through an experimental scenario based on a long-running workflow where an activity fails when invoking a Cloud-hosted Web service with a variable level of availability. On detecting this, the AWARD framework allows the dynamic reconfiguration of the corresponding activity to access a new Web service, and avoiding restarting the complete workflow.",

    "abstract": "In this brief, we have proposed a design strategy for an energy-efficient circuit/architecture to detect the onset of epileptic seizures with high efficacy. The architecture consists of two stages. The first stage is a low complexity Coastline parameter algorithm that consumes very low energy per computation. The second stage is a more efficacious wavelet-based algorithm (discrete wavelet transform-quasi-averaging) that consumes relatively higher energy and is powered ON only if determined by the low-complexity first stage. Using this proposed strategy, we achieve significant reduction in the energy consumption of the circuit by avoiding redundant computations, thereby increasing the longevity of the battery. We also observe that it leads to an improvement in efficacy. The two algorithms are user-programmable to compensate for the intersubject variations of neural signals. We use  in vivo  neural recordings from large animals (rats) to test the functionality of the system and calculate efficacy, subjected to minimum delay in detection. The system is simulated using 65-nm bulk-Si technology library. The simulated results show 32% energy savings (compared with a single-stage wavelet-based algorithm), consuming an average of 31.2 nJ/computation. The results also show a 12% increase in efficacy.",

Experimental results with a simulated alarm scenario show that our approach is able to compute solutions to the OMRTA problem in a distributed fashion and arguably in an optimal way.

    "abstract": "Sorting by Reversals (SBR) is one of the most widely studied models of genome rearrangements in computational molecular biology. At present, \\(\\frac{3}{2}\\) is the best known approximation ratio achievable in polynomial time for SBR. A very closely related problem, called Breakpoint Graph Decomposition (BGD), calls for a largest collection of edge disjoint cycles in a suitably-defined graph. It has been shown that for almost all instances SBR is equivalent to BGD, in the sense that any solution of the latter corresponds to a solution of the former having the same value. In this paper, we show how to improve the approximation ratio achievable in polynomial time for BGD, from the previously known \\(\\frac{3}{2}\\) to \\(\\frac{{33}}{{23}} + \\varepsilon \\) for any e > 0. Combined with the results in (Caprara, Journal of Combinatorial Optimization, vol. 3, pp. 149\u2013182, 1999b), this yields the same approximation guarantee for n! \u2212 O((n \u2212 5)!) out of the n! instances of SBR on permutations with n elements. Our result uses the best known approximation algorithms for Stable Set on graphs with maximum degree 4 as well as for Set Packing where the maximum size of a set is 6. Any improvement in the ratio achieved by these approximation algorithms will yield an automatic improvement of our result.",

    "abstract": "In web search engines, index search used to be evaluated at a high recall rate. However, the pitfall is that users have to work hard to select relevant documents from too many search results. Skillful surfers tend to prefer the index searching method, while on the other hand, those who are not accustomed to web searching generally use the directory search method. Therefore, the directory searching method is needed as a complementary way of web searching. However, in the case that target documents for searching are obscurely categorized or users have no exact knowledge about the appropriate categories of target documents, occasionally directory search will fail to come up with satisfactory results. That is, the directory search method has a high precision and low recall rate. With this motive, we propose a novel model in which a category hierarchy is dynamically constructed. To do this, a category is regarded as a fuzzy set which includes keywords. Similarly extensible subcategories of a category can be found using fuzzy relational products. The merit of this method is to enhance the recall rate of directory search by reconstructing subcategories on the basis of similarity.",

This proposed sensor network consists of mobile devices that are used as crowd monitoring participant nodes that employ light sensors, accelerometers, as well as audio and video sensors to collect the relevant data. Real-time crowd dynamics modeling and real-time activity modeling have been achieved by implementing the algorithms developed for Context Acquisition and multi-context fusion. Dynamic crowd monitoring was achieved by implementing the context based region identification and grouping of participants, distributed crowd behavior estimation, and stampede prediction based on distributed consensus. The implementation of the proposed architecture in Android smartphone provides light-weight, easy to deploy, context aware wireless services for effective crowd disaster mitigation and generation of an in time alert to take measures to avoid the occurrence of a stampede. The system has been tested and illustrated within a group of people for stampede prediction by using empirically collected data.",

Efficiency is analysed using fuzzy DEA techniques and the ranking is based on the statistical analysis of cases that include representative situations. The method enables the removal of the sometimes unrealistic hypothesis of a perfect trade-off between increased inputs and outputs. This model is compared with other DEA models that work with imprecise or fuzzy data. As an illustration, we apply our ranking method to the evaluation of a group of Spanish seaports, as well as teams playing in the Spanish football league. We compare the results with other methods and we show that our method enables a total ranking of the seaports, and that the ranking of football teams is found to be more consistent with final league positions.",

This has traditionally been one of the central areas of research in the field, and most of the solutions proposed so far have relied in one way or another upon some form of data mining---with the exception, of course, of human-constructed patterns. In this paper, we explore the use of Genetic Programming (GP) for such a purpose. Our approach is not new in some aspects, as GP has already been partially explored in the past. Here we show that GP can offer at least two advantages over other classical mechanisms: it can produce very lightweight detection rules (something of extreme importance for high-speed networks or resource-constrained applications) and the simplicity of the patterns generated allows to easily understand the semantics of the underlying attack.",

    "abstract": "The realization of space-efficient support hardware for built-in self-testing (BIST) is of great importance in the design and manufacture of VLSI circuits. Novel approaches to designing aliasing-free space compaction hardware were recently proposed in the context of testing cores-based system-on-chip (SOC) for single stuck-line faults, extending the well-known concepts of conventional switching theory, specifically those of cover table and frequency ordering commonly utilized in the simplification of switching functions, and of compatibility relation as used in the minimization of incomplete sequential machines, based on optimal generalized sequence mergeability, as developed and utilized by the authors in earlier works. The advantages of these aliasing-free compaction methods over earlier techniques are quite obvious, since zero-aliasing is achieved without any modifications of the module under test (MUT), while keeping the area overhead and signal propagation delay relatively low as contrasted with the conventional parity tree linear compactors. Besides, the approaches could be applied with both deterministic compacted and pseudorandom test patterns. The subject paper, without furnishing details of the different algorithms developed in the implementation of these approaches to designing zero-aliasing space compactors, provides the mathematical basis of selection criteria for merger of an optimal number of outputs of the MUT to achieve maximum compaction ratio in the design, along with some results from simulation experiments conducted on ISCAS 85 combinational and ISCAS 89 full-scan sequential benchmark circuits, with simulation programs ATALANTA, FSIM, and HOPE.",
