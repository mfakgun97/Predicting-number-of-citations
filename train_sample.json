A number of metrics have been proposed in the literature to measure text re-use between pairs of sentences or short passages. These individual metrics fail to reliably detect paraphrasing or semantic equivalence between sentences, due to the subjectivity and complexity of the task, even for human beings. This paper analyzes a set of five simple but weak lexical metrics for measuring textual similarity and presents a novel paraphrase detector with improved accuracy based on abductive machine learning. The objective here is 2-fold. First, the performance of each individual metric is boosted through the abductive learning paradigm. Second, we investigate the use of decision-level and feature-level information fusion via abductive networks to obtain a more reliable composite metric for additional performance enhancement. Several experiments were conducted using two benchmark corpora and the optimal abductive models were compared with other approaches. Results demonstrate that applying abductive learning has significantly improved the results of individual metrics and further improvement was achieved through fusion. Moreover, building simple models of polynomial functional elements that identify and integrate the smallest subset of relevant metrics yielded better results than those obtained from the support vector machine classifiers utilizing the same datasets and considered metrics. The results were also comparable to the best result reported in the literature even with larger number of more powerful features and/or using more computationally intensive techniques.",

    "abstract": "The comprehensive annotation of non-coding RNAs in newly sequenced genomes is still a largely unsolved problem because many functional RNAs exhibit not only poorly conserved sequences but also large variability in structure. In many cases, such as Y RNAs, vault RNAs, or telomerase RNAs, sequences differ by large insertions or deletions and have only a few small sequence patterns in common.#R##N##R##N#Here we present fragrep2, a purely sequence-based approach to detect such patterns in complete genomes. A fragrep2 pattern consists of an ordered list of position-specific weight matrices (PWMs) describing short, approximately conserved sequence elements, that are separated by intervals of non-conserved regions of bounded length. The program uses a fractional programming approach to align the PWMs to genomic DNA in order to allow for a bounded number of insertions and deletions in the patterns. These patterns are then combined to significant combinations of PWMs. At this step, a subset of PWMs may be deleted, i.e., have no match in the current region of the genome. The program furthermore estimates p- and E-values for the matches.#R##N##R##N#We apply fragrep2 to homology searches for RNase MRP, unveiling two previously unidentified matches as well as reproducing the results of two previous surveys. Furthermore, we complement the picture of vertebrate vault RNAs, a class of ncRNAs that has not received much attention so far.",

    "abstract": "The robotic motion planning criteria has evolved from kinematics to dynamics in recent years. Many research achievements have been made in dynamic motion planning, but the externally applied loads are usually limited to the gravity force. Due to the increasing demand for generic tasks, the motion should be generated for various functions such as pulling, pushing, twisting, and bending. In this paper, a comprehensive form of equations of motion, which includes the general external loads applied at any point of branched tree structures, is implemented. An optimization-based algorithm is then developed to generate load-effective motions of redundant tree-structured systems for generic tasks. A highly articulated dual-arm human model is used to generate different effective motions to sustain different external load magnitudes. The results also provide a new scientific insight of human motion.",

    "abstract": "In this paper, detection timing and channel selection for periodic spectrum sensing are investigated to improve the performance of cognitive radio (CR) users. Designed to maximize the channel efficiency of CR users under a given level of interference with licensed users, the detection timing scheme utilizes the statistics of the licensed channel occupancy to determine the optimal starting point of each sensing action. A channel selection scheme in the multichannel multiuser environment is also proposed to specify which channel to detect for the upcoming sensing action based on detection timing. Numerical results demonstrate that our schemes considerably improve the overall channel efficiency while protecting the communication among licensed users.",

    "abstract": "The development of computing applications by the people who have direct need for them in their work has become commonplace. During the 1980s, development of applications by \u201cend users\u201d accelerated and became a key management and research concern. Known as \u201cend-user computing,\u201d the phenomena and research associated with this trend cross a variety of disciplines. This article critically surveys the published literature on end-user computing (EUC) management according to a comprehensive research model. The article introduces the EUC management research model, identifies prior research contributions, and offers guideline for the future. The focal points of the model are two EUC management components which represent two different levels of theorizing found in the  literature. The first level focuses on the organization factors of strategy, technology, and management action. The second level focuses on the individual factors of end user, task, tool, and end-user action. The remainder of the model includes factors typically investigated as the antecedents (context) and consequences (outcomes) of EUC. More than 90 English-language articles published from 1983-1990 are mapped into the model. Specific variables for each factor are identified; research streams are interpreted; findings are synthesized; and gaps in our knowledge are highlighted. We then raise a number of substantive and methodological issues that need to be addressed and suggest two themes we envision as important for EUC management research in the 1990s: EUC as an extension of  organizational computing and EUC as a social learning phenomenon. Guidance is offered for using these theme to inform future research.",

    "abstract": "Range of applications for Wireless Sensor Networks (WSNs) is increasing rapidly. One class of such applications is Energy-Aware Wireless Positioning Systems for situation awareness. Localization deals with determining a target node\u2019s position in WSN by analyzing signals exchanged between nodes. Received Signal Strength Indicator (RSSI) represents the ratio between received signal power and a reference power, and is typically used to estimate distances between nodes. RSSI distance estimations are affected by many factors. This paper aims to enhance the accuracy of RSSI-based localization techniques in ZigBee Networks through studying the communication channel status between two nodes. As the network nodes are exposed to high noise levels, position estimation accuracy deteriorates. A novel adaptive localization scheme is proposed; Two-State Markov model with moving average is employed to detect unpredictable RSSI readings that may reflect badly on the estimation. The proposed scheme achieves better estimation accuracy, for example, the estimation error was reduced from 11.7 m to just 3 m using the proposed scheme.",

    "abstract": "Abstract   First, the cerebellar model articulation controller (CMAC), invented in the early 1970s by Albus, and the associative memory system (AMS), developed for learning control systems by H. Tolle  et al.  in the early 1980s, are briefly described. The underlying mathematics of the AMS learning or training algorithm is then given with a geometrical interpretation from which its convergence properties may be deduced. These are illustrated for some simple cases.  The original algorithm devised by Albus is very simple to compute but is slow to converge, and the second part of the paper investigates various algorithms with improved convergence properties. One of these, the so-called \u201cmaximum error\u201d algorithm, is particularly recommended.",

    "abstract": "Industrial evaluations of COTS software largely used the quality models provided by the international standards. But the context and objectives of COTS evaluations are fundamentally different than those primarily defined by the standards. Several key issues are often forgotten: (1) the existence of several evaluators and several quality models sharing common factors, criteria and measures, (2) the purpose of the evaluation model, (3) measures of different types, and (4) the recursive nature of the model since each node is an evaluation model itself. We had the occasion to study the results of real standard-based COTS evaluations. Faced with the difficulties to exploit them, we experimented the use of multi-criteria methodology. This work allows us to understand some of the problems generated by the application of the standards to COTS evaluations, and to propose new principles for evaluating software quality that should be considered in an evolution of the standards. This paper reports our experiment.",

This algorithm solved several problems faster than vanilla value iteration.",

    "abstract": "Modern graphics cards are equipped with a vertex cache to reduce the amount of data needing to be transmitted to the graphics pipeline during rendering. To make effective use of the cache and facilitate rendering, it is key to represent a mesh in a manner that maximizes the cache hit rate. In this paper, we propose a simple yet effective algorithm for generating a sequence for efficient rendering of 3D polygonal meshes based on greedy optimization. The algorithm outperforms the current state-of-the-art algorithms in terms of rendering efficiency of the resultant sequence. We also adapt it for the rendering of progressive meshes. For any simplified version of the original mesh, the rendering sequence is generated by adaptively updating the reordered sequence at full resolution. The resultant rendering sequence is cheap to compute and has reasonably good rendering performance, which is desirable to many complex rendering environments involving continuous rendering of meshes at various level of details. The experimental results on a collection of 3D meshes are provided.",

    "abstract": "Many  facts  about emerging nanotechnologies are yet to be assessed. There are still major concerns, for instance, about maximum achievable device density, or about which architecture is best fit for a specific application. Growing complexity requires taking into account many aspects of technology, application and architecture  at the same time . Researchers face problems that are not new per se, but are now subject to very different constraints, that need to be captured by design tools. Among the emerging nanotechnologies, two-dimensional nanowire based arrays represent promising nanostructures, especially for massively parallel computing architectures. Few attempts have been done, aimed at giving the possibility to explore architectural solutions, deriving information from extensive and reliable nanoarray characterization. Moreover, in the nanotechnology arena there is still not a clear winner, so it is important to be able to target different technologies, not to miss the next big thing.   We present a tool, ToPoliNano, that enables such a multi-technological characterization in terms of logic behavior, power and timing performance, area and layout constraints, on the basis of specific technological and topological descriptions. This tool can aid the design process, beside providing a comprehensive simulation framework for DC and timing simulations, and detailed power analysis. Design and simulation results will be shown for nanoarray-based circuits.   ToPoliNano is the first real design tool that tackles the top down design of a circuit based on emerging technologies.",

    "abstract": "This paper investigates a method for increasing the involvement of marketing fourth year learners in academic research, by encouraging greater participation in, and commitment to, their research project in the Applied Marketing IV subject. It is assumed that greater involvement will result in a greater pass rate. The main reasons for this lack of interest were found to be a sense of incompetence and a lack of resources which were the main objectives of a research project. These objectives were addressed by using learner centered methodologies with the research method Action Research. This research method with the slow resolution of problems was used together with a teaching methodology whose objectives supported the resolution of the learners' inadequacies. Formative assessment was used at the start of the measuring of the learners' progress and was found useful with its quick and positive feedback in supporting the learners' confidence. An eClassroom was structured for the implementation of the Applied Marketing IV course. It was designed in such a way that it facilitated the learners' use of the more commonly used devices such as surfing the web, email and Internet over and above the chosen course material. Although it was not possible to complete the main intervention of the project it was possible to use the participants' experiences in the navigation of the course material in the eClassroom, to further develop future follow-up courses.",

    "abstract": "As a distinctive feature of Information Centric Networking (ICN), in-network caching plays a fundamental role on system performance. The line-speed requirement of in-network caching invalidates the employ of complex collaborative caching schemes. The cache management of in-network caching includes three components - cache placement, cache replacement and cache location. Coupling the three pieces would make more efficient use of in-network caches, but existing in-network caching schemes consider only one or two of the three pieces. This work enhances in-network caching with a low complexity cache placement scheme that takes into account content popularity, hop reduction gains, cache space contention and replacement penalty and couples with cache replacement and location, here dubbed PRL (coupling cache Placement, Replacement and Location). PRL keeps data chunks that are more popular and farther away to fetch at an en-route router with less cache space contention. And PRL locates cached copies so as to serve a higher proportion of requests from in-network caches. Our preliminary simulation results suggest that PRL increases cache hit ratio and reduces the average hop count traversed by users' requests and the caching operations at routers as compared to existing representative innetwork caching schemes.",

Using a profit function that includes both the cost of production and a penalty for under-production, we show that obtaining an optimal mean setting is straightforward. As the ingredient cost becomes small compared to recycling and production costs, the relative profit is found to be a strongly asymmetric function of the process mean. The resulting managerial insights suggest that, with respect to optimal mean setting, for a wide variety of cost parameters, overfilling is in general better than underfilling.",

    "abstract": "A device that performs private key operations (signatures or decryptions), and whose private key operations are protected by a password, can be immunized against offline dictionary attacks in case of capture by forcing the device to confirm a password guess with a designated remote server in order to perform a private key operation. Recent proposals for achieving this allow untrusted servers and require no server initialization per device. In this paper we extend these proposals to enable dynamic delegation from one server to another; i.e., the device can subsequently use the second server to secure its private key operations. One application is to allow a user who is traveling to a foreign country to temporarily delegate to a server local to that country the ability to confirm password guesses and aid the user's device in performing private key operations, or in the limit, to temporarily delegate this ability to a token in the user's possession. Another application is proactive security for the device's private key, i.e., proactive updates to the device and servers to eliminate any threat of offline password guessing attacks due to previously compromised servers.",

    "abstract": "Inter symbol interference and related distortions observed in high data rate wireless systems are mitigated using equalizers and channel estimation methods which are traditionally based on data driven tapped delay line (TDL) models. With increased fading due to mobility of transmit receive terminals, data driven schemes prove to be inefficient. Further, the TDL model assumes the dispersive channel to be linear in nature unlike the practical case which is non-linear, resulting in degraded performance. In such a situation, extrapolation of the channel state information is required which has been done by using artificial neural networks (ANN) optimized for non-linear channels. We explore a few neuro-computational approaches namely focused time delay neural network, feed forward ANN (FANN)\u2013decision feedback equalizer (DFE) (FANN\u2013DFE) and a functional link neural network while modeling non-linear wireless channels. Further, implementation of FANN\u2013DFE based algorithm has been carried out using a specialized hardware framework to show the reduction of computational latency during training to establish its suitability for real time applications.",

    "abstract": "The problems of stage-preserving linearization and one-boundedness are studied for a class of nonlinear single rule recursive programs, and syntactic characterizations are developed for both. The characterizations lead to a polynomial-time algorithm for the former and a linear-time algorithm for the latter. Stage-preserving linearization results in a significant improvement in evaluation efficiency, compared to a linearization that does not preserve stages. The class of nonlinear strips that are stage-preserving linearizable includes several classes of programs that can be linearized only using a mix of left and right linear rules, as well as programs that cannot be linearized using previously known techniques. The study makes use of a technique based on the notion of homomorphic tree embeddings. >",

In this paper, a simple technique for evaluating the current load of network is proposed. If a computer is connected to several networks, then we can get the load index of that host for each network. We can also measure the load index of the network applied by all the hosts. The dynamic resource manager of DeSiDeRaTa should use this technique to achieve its requirements.

On the other hand, although the serial architectures are very efficient in terms of hardware requirement, they suffer from low throughput.

In our approach, the multiple time-delay analogue transfer function matrix with multiple input-output time delays is minimally realised using a continuous-time state-space model. For deriving an explicit form of the optimal digital controller, the realised continuous-time multiple input-output time-delay system is discretised, and an extended high-order discrete-time state-space model is constructed for discrete-time LQR design. To derive a low-order optimal digital observer for the multiple input-output time-delay system, the multiple time-delay state obtained from the multiple time-delay outputs is discretised. Then, the well-known duality concept is employed to design an optimal digital observer using the low-order discretised multiple input time-delay system together with the newly discretised multiple time-delay state. The proposed approach is restricted to multiple time-delay systems where multiple time delays arise only in the input and output, and not in the state.",

    "abstract": "Multi-Criteria Decision Making (MCDM) aims to develop techniques that are able to make decisions and solve complex problems where the outcome is a factor of various conflicting criteria. Intuitionistic Fuzzy Sets (IFSs) have been shown to provide a suitable framework for dealing with decision-making systems involving membership, non-membership and hesitation which showed very good results when dealing with conflicting criteria. On the other hand, Group Decision Making (GDM) deals with decision-making systems which need to consider the opinions of a group of experts whose decisions and opinions are subject to linguistic uncertainties. Previous research has shown the power of interval type-2 fuzzy logic systems to handle the linguistic uncertainties in decision-making systems. In this paper, we propose a hybrid method combining interval type-2 fuzzy logic and IFSs to develop a Multi-Criteria Group Decision Making (MCGDM) system. The intuitionistic evaluation in interval type-2 membership functions has been derived from the proposed method which includes eight steps for the aggregation and ranking of the preference alternatives. We will present results from the proposed system deployment for the assessment of the postgraduate study where the evaluation involved 10 candidates. The proposed system was able to model the variation in the group decision-making process exhibited by the various decision-makers' opinions. In addition, the proposed system was able to provide a better agreement with human decisions compared to IFS, type-1 and interval type-2 fuzzy systems.",

    "abstract": "Abstract  A computer-based pre- and post-operative analysis of total hip replacement (THR) is presented. The analysis was performed by using and innovative combination of X-ray measurements and gait analysis. The several important biomechanical factors that affect effective THR are analysed in a test clinical case of conversion of hip fusion into THR. Geometrical positioning of the artificial joint should restore correct motion and adequate leverage of the surrounding muscles in order to exert the appropriate functional joint moments. Hip joint centre positioning pre- and post-operation was evaluated using a computer-based X-ray measurement tool. This enabled the calculation of the medio-lateral and proximal\u2013distal off-set of the joint centre, the lever arms of the abductor muscles and the limb length discrepancy. Pre- and post-operative function was also evaluated using gait analysis, including joint kinematics, kinetics and electromyography. The whole analysis suggests that a good restoration of joint motion, a regression of pelvic compensation and a phasic activity of gluteus medius occur only when a good positioning of the prosthetic hip joint is obtained. This study proved a fundamental role played by these two computer-based tools in the support of the clinical decision making process.",

    "abstract": "In this paper we present a logic restructuring tool for digital circuits implemented in MUX-based FPGAs. In this tool, logic optimization is achieved by incremental transformations of a mapped network. Working on a technology-dependent network allows to take into account accurate estimations of module count and delay of the circuit. The transformations are identified with the use of efficient Automatic Test pattern Generation (ATPG) based techniques that are able to operate directly on a structural circuit description. To this purpose, we have extended these techniques to the case of MUX-based FPGA mapped networks. Experimental results show that significant reduction in delay and module count can be obtained with this approach on the ACT1 architecture. This approach can be easily applied to other MUX-based architectures as well as post-layout delay optimization by directly using post-layout delay estimations.",

The only known solution for defining such trajectory is to encircle a cusp point in the joint space. In this paper, the aspects and the characteristic surfaces are computed for each operation mode to define the uniqueness of the domains. Thus, we can easily see in the workspace that at least three assembly modes can be reached for each operation mode. To validate this property, the mathematical analysis of the determinant of the Jacobian is done. The image of these trajectories in the joint space is depicted with the curves associated with the cusp points.",

Furthermore, it is applied to the line in a large temporary disaster are expected to FSO. In addition, FSO can be applied as a fiber backup when the disaster occurred. However, since the light beam has high directivity in free space link, the shock and vibration due to environmental changes, will lead to large misalignment between the transmitting and receiving antennas. Therefore, their impact on the stability of the FSO communication system should be investigated. In this paper, we describe the results of the basic measurement data obtained at the Great East Japan Earthquake that occurred in March 2011. We investigate the impact of the earthquake on the tracking system technology for FSO that we have developed. Furthermore, we show the effectiveness of the proposed error correction for reducing the impact of earthquakes on the communication link.",

    "abstract": "The new PHOENIX code is discussed together with a sample of many new results that are obtained concerning magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) spectra of axisymmetric plasmas where flow and gravity are consistently taken into account. PHOENIX, developed from the CASTOR code [W. Kerner, J.P. Goedbloed, G.T.A. Huysmans, S. Poedts, E. Schwarz, J. Comput. Phys. 142 (1998) 271], incorporates purely toroidal, or both toroidal and poloidal flow and external gravitational fields to compute the entire ideal or resistive MHD spectrum for general tokamak or accretion disk configurations. These equilibria are computed by means of FINESSE [A.J.C. Belien, M.A. Botchev, J.P. Goedbloed, B. van der Holst, R. Keppens, J. Comp. Physics 182 (2002) 91], which discriminates between the different elliptic flow regimes that may occur. PHOENIX makes use of a finite element method in combination with a spectral method for the discretization. This leads to a large generalized eigenvalue problem, which is solved by means of Jacobi\u2013Davidson algorithm [G.L.G. Sleijpen, H.A. van der Vorst, SIAM J. Matrix Anal. Appl. 17 (1996) 401].#R##N##R##N#PHOENIX is compared with CASTOR, PEST-1 and ERATO for an internal mode of Soloviev equilibria. Furthermore, the resistive internal kink mode has been computed to demonstrate that the code can accurately handle small values for the resistivity. A new reference test case for a Soloviev-like equilibrium with toroidal flow shows that, on a particular unstable mode, the flow has a quantifiable stabilizing effect regardless of the direction of the flow. PHOENIX reproduces the Toroidal Flow induced Alfven Eigenmode (TFAE, [B. van der Holst, A.J.C. Belien, J.P. Goedbloed, Phys. Rev. Lett. 84 (2000) 2865]) where finite resistivity in combination with equilibrium flow effects causes resonant damping. Localized ideal gap modes are presented for tokamak plasmas with toroidal and poloidal flow. Finally, we demonstrate the ability to spectrally diagnose magnetized accretion disk equilibria where gravity acts together with either purely toroidal flow or both toroidal and poloidal flow. These cases show that the MHD continua can be unstable or overstable due to the presence of a gravitational field together with equilibrium flow-driven dynamics [J.P. Goedbloed, A.J.C. Belien, B. van der Holst, R. Keppens, Phys. Plasmas 11 (2004) 28].",

    "abstract": "a b s t r a c t To case-II waters, suspended particulate matter (SPM) is one of the dominant water constituents, SPM concentration (CSPM) is a key parameter describing water quality, and developing remote sensing-based CSPM retrieval models is foundation for obtaining its spatiotemporal distributions. This study aimed to develop moderate resolution imaging spectroradiometer (MODIS)-based CSPM empirical retrieval models in Dongting Lake, China. The 95 CSPM measurements on 31 August 2012 and 14 June 2013 and their corresponding MODIS Terra images were used to calibrate models, and the model calibra- tion results showed that the 250 m MODIS red band obtained better fitting accuracies than the near infrared band; the quadratic and exponential models of single red band explained 75% (estimated standard errors (SE) = 6.19 mg/l) and 71% (SE = 6.54 mg/l) of the variation of CSPM; and the quadratic and exponential models of red minus shortwave infrared (SWIR) band at 1240 and 1640 nm explained 72-73% (SE = 6.43-6.48 mg/l) and 68-69% (SE = 6.83-6.96 mg/l) of the variations of CSPM, respectively. The quadratic and exponential models of red band and red minus SWIR band were applied to the MODIS Terra image on 16 September 2013 to estimate CSPM values. By comparing the estimated CSPM values on 16 September 2013 and the measured ones on 17 September 2013 at 40 sampling points for model val- idations, the results indicated that there exited significantly strong correlations between the measured and estimated CSPM values at a significance level of 0.05 for all models, and the exponential model of red minus SWIR band at 1240 nm achieved the best estimation result within all models. Such result pro- vided foundation for obtaining the spatiotemporal distribution information of CSPM from MODIS images in Dongting Lake, which will be helpful for understanding, managing and protecting this ecosystem. \u00a9 2014 Elsevier B.V.

    "abstract": "A tone classifier is an essential part of an automatic tonal speech recognizer (ATSR) because tonal languages recognize word meaning by tones. However, many researchers have developed a highly efficient tone recognition by using rich mathematical techniques and used the whole input speech as an input of pitch detection process. This paper proposes a reduced complexity tone classifier for the automatic tonal speech recognizer. The classifier reduces the number of input frames by detecting only the vowel signals as an input of the pitch detection, called vowel-AMDF (V-AMDF). The classifier uses a lower number of floating-point operations (FLOPs) than used in the whole input speech method. Due to the reduced number of FLOPs, this tone classifier can be suitable for portable electronic equipment. In addition, V-AMDF reduces F 0  contour errors caused by the influence from neighboring syllables. This proposed classifier was tested and set by 19 Thai words, selected from voice activation for GPS system and phone dialing options. The experimental results show 86.0% recognition accuracy, and 21.8% reduction in the number of FLOPs, compared with using the whole input speech.",

    "abstract": "With a meaning-preserving restructuring tool, a software engineer can change a program's structure to ease future modifications. However, deciding how to restructure the program requires a global understanding of the program's structure, which cannot be derived easily by directly inspecting the source code. We describe a manipulable program visualization\u2014the  star diagram \u2014that supports the restructuring task of encapsulating a global data structure. The star diagram graphically displays information pertinent to encapsulation, and direct manipulation of the diagram causes the underlying program to be restructured. The visualization compactly presents all statements in the program that use the given global data structure, helping the programmer to choose the  functions that completely encapsulate it. Additionally, the visualization elides code unrelated to the data structure and to the task and collapses similar expressions to help the programmer identify frequently occurring code fragments and manipulate them together. The visualization is mapped directly to the program text, so manipulation of the visualization also restructures the program. We present the star diagram concept and describe an implementation of the star diagram built upon a meaning-preserving restructuring tool for Scheme. We also describe our creation of star diagram generators for C programs, and we test the scalability of the star diagram using large C and MUMPS programs.",

    "abstract": "Parity games are a powerful formalism for the automatic synthesis and verification of reactive systems. They are closely related to alternating \u03c9-automata and emerge as a natural method for the so- lution of the \u03bc-calculus model checking problem. Due to these strict connections, parity games are a well-established environment to describe liveness properties such as \"every request that occurs infinitely often is eventually responded\". Unfortunately, the classical form of such a con- dition suffers from the strong drawback that there is no bound on the effective time that separates a request from its response, i.e., responses are not promptly provided. Recently, to overcome this limitation, several parity game variants have been proposed, in which quantitative require- ments are added to the classic qualitative ones. In this paper, we make a general study of the concept of promptness in parity games that allows to put under a unique theoretical framework several of the cited variants along with new ones. Also, we describe simple polynomial reductions from all these conditions to either Buchi or parity games, which simplify all previous known procedures. In particular, they improve the complexity results of cost and bounded-cost parity games. Indeed, we provide solution algorithms showing that determining the winner of these games lies in UPTime \u2229 CoUPTime.",

    "abstract": "A general class of variational models with concave priors is considered for obtaining certain sparse solutions, for which nonsmoothness and non-Lipschitz continuity of the objective functions pose significant challenges from an analytical as well as numerical point of view. For computing a stationary point of the underlying variational problem, a Newton-type scheme with provable convergence properties is proposed. The possible non-positive definiteness of the generalized Hessian is handled by a tailored regularization technique, which is motivated by reweighting as well as the classical trust-region method. Our numerical experiments demonstrate selected applications in image processing, support vector machines, and optimal control of partial differential equations.",

    "abstract": "This study aims to develop car following models which simulate various adaptive cruise control (ACC) behaviors for a microscopic traffic simulator. There is a need for a microscopic traffic simulator to evaluate the impact of ACC penetration on highway traffic conditions. If the method of modeling of the simulator follows ACC technology as it is in the real world, the update frequency will be in millisecond order. This may result in an unexpected increase in the calculation time and often spoil the practical use of the simulator. To avoid this situation, it is necessary to develop a car following model which can simulate ACC with sufficient accuracy for impact assessment and which works in sub-second frequency, which is common for many microscopic traffic simulators. This paper outlines the Intelligent Driver Model and its derivations, which have many preferable features. Those model equations are modified to simulate three types of ACC behaviors which retain distance gap, time gap and time headway, and we verified their behaviors through computational platoon experiments with four cars.",

We chose to exploit those computational processes that require less intervention by the user, gaining objectivity and reliability as a result. The algorithm joins the covariance matrix and the cross-correlation techniques, and all the computation steps are interspersed by several automatic checks intended to verify the reliability of the yields. The resulting semiautomation generates two new advantages in the field of anisotropy studies: handling a huge amount of data at the same time, and comparing different yields. From this perspective, SPY has been developed in the Matlab environment, which is widespread, versatile, and user-friendly. Our intention is to provide the scientific community with a new monitoring tool for tracking the temporal variations of the crustal stress field.",

Wright's equation shows that evolution is doing gradient ascent in a landscape defined by the average fitness of the population. The average fitness W is defined in terms of marginal gene frequencies pi. Wright's equation is only approximately valid in population genetics, but it exactly describes the behavior of our univariate marginal distribution algorithm (UMDA). We apply Wright's equation to a specific fitness function defined by Wright. Furthermore we introduce mutation into Wright's equation and UMDA. We show that mutation moves the stable attractors from the boundary into the interior. We compare Wright's equation with the diversified replicator equation. We show that a fast version of Wright's equation gives very good results for optimizing a class of binary fitness functions.",

    "abstract": "Developing rule extraction algorithms from machine learning techniques such as artificial neural networks and support vector machines (SVMs), which are considered incomprehensible black-box models, is an important topic in current research. This study proposes a rule extraction algorithm from SVMs that uses a kernel-based clustering algorithm to integrate all support vectors and genetic algorithms into extracted rule sets. This study uses measurements of accuracy, sensitivity, specificity, coverage, fidelity and comprehensibility to evaluate the performance of the proposed method on the public credit screening data sets. Results indicate that the proposed method performs better than other rule extraction algorithms. Thus, the proposed algorithm is an essential analysis tool that can be effectively used in data mining fields.",

    "abstract": "In this paper, we present a new class of restart policies, called  width-based  policies, for modern clause-learning SAT solvers. The new policies encourage the solvers to find refutation proofs with small widths by determining restarting points based on the sizes of conflict clauses learned rather than the number of conflicts experienced by the solvers. We show that width-based restart policies can outperform traditional restart policies on some special classes of SAT problems. We then propose different ways of adjusting the width parameter of the policies. Our experiment on industrial problems shows that width-based policies are competitive with the restart policy used by many state-of-the-art solvers. Moreover, we find that the combination of these two types of restart policies yields improvements on many classes of problems.",

Four electronic devices with AC mains and telecommunication ports were modeled using a 4-port network, and the parameters of the network were obtained from measuring impedance and transmission loss. We evaluated the decoupling factor from the mains port to the telecommunication port of a VDSL modem using these parameters for the four electric and electronic devices. The results indicate that the mean value of the decoupling factor for the differential and common mode signals were more than 88 and 62dB, respectively, in the frequency range of a PLC system. Taking the following parameters into consideration; decoupling factor Ld, the average transmission signal powers of VDSL and PLC, desired and undesired (DU) ratio, and transmission loss of a typical 300-m-long indoor telecommunication line, the VDSL system cannot be disturbed by the PLC signal induced into the VDSL modem from the AC mains port in normal installation.",

    "abstract": "An innovative 3D multi-branch tubular structure and centerline extraction method is proposed in this paper. In contrast to classical minimal path techniques that can only detect a single curve between two pre-defined initial points, this method propagates outward from only one initial seed point to detect 3D multi-branch tubular surfaces and centerlines simultaneously. First, instead of only representing the trajectory of a tubular structure as a 3D curve, the surface of the entire structure is represented as a 4D curve along which every point represents a 3D sphere inside the tubular structure. Then, from any given sphere inside the tubular structure, a novel 4D iterative key point searching scheme is applied, in which the minimal action map and the Euclidean length map are calculated with a 4D freezing fast marching evolution. A set of 4D key points is obtained during the front propagation process. Finally, by sliding back from each key point to the previous one via the minimal action map until all the key points are visited, we are able to fully obtain global minimizing multi-branch tubular surfaces. An additional immediate benefit of this method is a natural notion of a multi-branch tube's \"central curve\" by taking only the first three spatial coordinates of the detected 4D multi-branch curve. Experimental results on 2D/3D medical vascular images illustrate the benefits of this method.",

In order to significantly advance our understanding of the function of a system, we need to learn the causal relationships among its modeled genes. To this end, it is desirable to compare experiments of the system under complete interventions of some genes, e.g., knock-out of some genes, with experiments of the system without interventions. However, it is expensive and difficult (if not impossible) to conduct wet lab experiments of complete interventions of genes in animal models, e.g., a mouse model. Thus, it will be helpful if we can discover promising causal relationships among genes with observational data alone in order to identify promising genes to perturb in the system that can later be verified in wet laboratories.

We review six topological network indicators in order to describe the detailed structure of a project network. These indicators were originally developed by [L.V. Tavares, J.A. Ferreira and J.S. Coelho, The risk of delay of a project in terms of the morphology of its network, European Journal of Operational Research 119 (1999), 510\u2013537] and have been modified, or sometimes completely replaced, by alternative indicators to describe the network topology. The contribution of this paper is twofold. Firstly, we generate a large amount of different networks with four project network generators. Our general conclusions are that none of the network generators are able to capture the complete feasible domain of all networks. Additionally, each network generator covers its own network-specific domain and, consequently, contributes to the generation of data sets. Secondly, we perform computational results on the well-known resource-constrained project scheduling problem to prove that our indicators are reliable and have significant, predictive power to serve as complexity indicators.",

We model the customers' waiting psychology and service preparation time into the online TSP with the objective to serve as many requests as possible. More specifically, each request has a disclosure time before accepting service at its release time, and a deadline, which is no bigger than its release time plus the travel time from origin to its position. We give lower bounds for the competitive ratios, online algorithms, and quantify the influence of advanced information on competitive ratios.",

    "abstract": "Product complexity in the aerospace industry has grown fast while design procedures and techniques did not keep pace. Product life cycle implications are largely neglected during the early design phase. Also, aerospace designers fail to optimize products for the intended operational environment. This study shows how a design, simulated within its anticipated operational environment, can inform about critical design parameters, thereby creating a more targeted design improving the chance of commercial success. An agent-based operational simulation for civil Unmanned Aerial Vehicles conducting maritime Search-and-Rescue missions is used to design and optimize aircrafts. Agent interactions with their environment over the product life-cycle are shown to lead to unexpected model outputs. Unique insights into the optimal design are gained by analysis of the operational performance of the aircraft within its simulated environment.",

    "abstract": "Derivations in phrase-structure grammars are by now well understood, and it is generally considered convenient to study equivalence classes of derivations rather than individual derivations themselves. It has been established that classes can be represented by canonical derivations, syntactical graphs, or derivation words, and the categorical algebra of derivations provides the framework for their study. Regarded in this way, it is known that each derivation induces a distributive lattice of subderivations. In this paper a simple algorithm is given for enumerating this lattice for any derivation. The simplicity of this algorithm depends on the nature of the topological sort which allows a canonical derivation (or derivation word) to be constructed uniquely from a syntactical graph. The enumeration algorithm constructs the members of the lattice directly. In the process a new characterization of the syntactical graphs is given using the concept of a \u201cdoubly ordered graph.\u201d This characterization greatly simplifies some of the previous work in this field. A direct correspondence between these graphs and the symmetric group (set of permutations) is shown.",

The capability of a robot largely depends on the workspace of the manipulator apart from other parameters. In this work, an evolutionary optimization algorithm based on foraging behavior of Escherichia coli bacteria present in human intestine is utilized to optimize the workspace volume of a 3R manipulator. The proposed optimization method is subjected to some modifications for faster convergence than the original algorithm. Further, the method is also very useful in optimization problems in a highly constrained environment such as the robot workspace optimization. The test results are compared with standard results available using other optimization algorithms such as Differential Evolution, Genetic Algorithm and Particle Swarm Optimization. In addition, this work extends the application of the proposed algorithm to two different industrial robots. An important implication of this paper is that the present algorithm is found to be superior to other methods in terms of computational efficiency.",

In this paper, we formulate this problem from the decision theoretic perspective using the framework of Decentralized Partially Observable Markov Decision Processes (DEC-POMDP). Formulating the coordination problem in this way provides a formal foundation for study of cooperation activities. But, as it has been recently shown solving DEC-POMDP is NEXP-complete and thus it is not a realistic approach for the design of agent cooperation policies. However, we demonstrate in this paper that it is not completely desperate. Indeed, we propose an heuristic approach for solving DEC-POMDP when agents are memory-less and when the global reward function can be broken up into a sum of local reward functions. We demonstrate experimentally on an example (the so-called pursuit problem) that this heuristic is efficient within a few iteration steps.",

Centroid contours of the PC clusters were used for contour reconstruction in the resynthesis experiments. The prototype intonation and intensity contours were superimposed over non-glottalized word-initial vowels in order to resynthesize creaky voice.

    "abstract": "This paper presents two new greedy sensor placement algorithms, named minimum nonzero eigenvalue pursuit (MNEP) and maximal projection on minimum eigenspace (MPME), for linear inverse problems, with greater emphasis on the MPME algorithm for performance comparison with existing approaches. In both MNEP and MPME, we select the sensing locations one-by-one. In this way, the least number of required sensor nodes can be determined by checking whether the estimation accuracy is satisfied after each sensing location is determined. For the MPME algorithm, the minimum eigenspace is defined as the eigenspace associated with the minimum eigenvalue of the dual observation matrix. For each sensing location, the projection of its observation vector onto the minimum eigenspace is shown to be monotonically decreasing w.r.t. the worst case error variance (WCEV) of the estimated parameters. We select the sensing location whose observation vector has the maximum projection onto the minimum eigenspace of the current dual observation matrix. The proposed MPME is shown to be one of the most computationally efficient algorithms. Our Monte-Carlo simulations showed that MPME outperforms the convex relaxation method, the SparSenSe method, and the FrameSense method in terms of WCEV and the mean square error (MSE) of the estimated parameters, especially when the number of available sensor nodes is very limited.",

In this emerging data management domain, queries are posed over multiple semistructured information sources distributed across a wide-area network. Each source may be autonomous and may potentially have data of a different format and new sources are frequently added. We present the basic elements of a new weakly coupled semantics that correctly captures the modular structure of a data-intensive P2P system, and opens up the possibility of effective query answering techniques. One of the basic characteristics of peers in our approach is that they are based on abstract object types, which encapsulate a data integration system in order to deal with incomplete Web-based information, and to offer a rich ontology interface to their clients. We describe an incremental algorithm for answering conjunctive queries posed to one peer. The contributions to the query answer of any peer are given by the certain answers that such peer provides. We show that the algorithm supports the high parallelism in the process of query answering from different peers. Such parallelism can be modulated from the massive parallelism to the minor forms of parallelism, which depends from the user incremental-answering strategy.",

    "abstract": "There is growing interest in the use of wireless mesh network WMN as a last-mile option for Internet access. Despite the many benefits of WMNs, the performance of Internet access may not be ideal. One of the main issues is the interaction of transmission control protocol TCP with the underlying network. The poor performance of TCP over multi-hop networks is well-documented, and extensive research exists, which addresses TCPs foible and enhance TCP performance for multi-hop environments. This paper provides a thorough survey of TCP performance issues over WMNs and the available solutions to address these issues. Among the existing methods, we focused on network coding NC and the ways that TCP interacts with network coded systems. NC is a technique that encodes the received packets in each node before forwarding them towards the destination. The use of NC in the transport layer to address performance issues raised by wireless access is a recent research topic. This paper presents a detailed study of TCP interaction with NC. Some open research areas in this field are suggested. Copyright \u00a9 2012 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.",

    "abstract": "An algebraic parameter identification method for, high rate, sampled linear systems is proposed for the output feedback control of a completely unknown DC motor. The parameter estimation method is based on the algebraic methodology (introduced by Fliess and Sira-Ramirez in [1]) for continuous time systems. In this article, we adapt the algebraic parameter identification methodology so that it takes into account sampling effects. We apply the algebraic identification method within the delta operator framework developed by Middleton and Goodwin in [2]. Delta operators constitute an effective alternative, over the Z-transform, for working with fast sampled systems. One of its advantages ensures a smooth transition between a continuous and a high sampled discrete sampled system. We use a delta operator-based algebraic identification scheme for the construction of the involved linear regressor in combination with a special invariant filtering to improve the identifier against additive noise effects. Our invariant filtering coincides with the least squares solution of the linear regressor equation. A delta-operator based output feedback controller of the Generalized Proportional Integral (GPI) type is also proposed for the solution of the output trajectory tracking problem, for the DC-motor, as a certainty equivalence controller. The fast identification of all system parameters is used in the certainty equivalent feedback control law design. Some experimental results are presented which validate the effectiveness of the proposed approach.",

The design methodology employs very simple tuning circuits and can be easily fabricated in a low cost digital CMOS process. The PWM circuit consumes 24 /spl mu/A at 2.5 V (10 /spl mu/A at 1.3 V). This design is thus suitable for micropower low voltage applications including hearing instruments. Measurements on the prototype IC shows that the error at zero-input 50% duty cycle is 1.5% and the total harmonic distortion is 3.3% at near full modulation index.",

    "abstract": "Adaptive estimation over distributed networks has received a lot of attention due to its broad range of applications. A useful estimation strategy is diffusion adaptive network, where the parameters of interest can be well estimated from noisy measurements through diffusion cooperation between nodes. The conventional diffusion algorithms exhibit good performance in the presence of Gaussian noise but their performance decreases in presence of impulsive noise. The aim of the present paper is to propose a robust diffusion based algorithm that alleviates the effect of impulsive noise. To this end, we move beyond mean squared error (MSE) criterion and recast the estimation problem in terms of the maximum correntropy criterion (MCC). We use stochastic gradient ascent and useful approximations to derive an adaptive algorithm which is appropriate for distributed implementation. The resultant algorithm has the computational simplicity of the popular LMS algorithm, along with the robustness that is obtained by using higher order moments. We present some simulations results which show that the proposed algorithm outperforms existing alternative that rely MSE criterion.",

    "abstract": "The implications of vergence control and active vision for stereopsis in robots and humans are investigated. It is argued that the geometry of verging systems places strong constraints on the ecological role of stereopsis. In particular, stereopsis is poorly suited to building whole-field depth maps but well suited to gathering information about specific targets of interest in the scene in a coordinate frame referenced to the fixation point. A simple, fast stereo system targeted at the latter goal is presented. >",

    "abstract": "In this paper, a hybrid learning approach named hybrid decision tree (HDT) is proposed. HDT simulates human reasoning by using symbolic learning to do qualitative analysis and using neural learning to do subsequent quantitative analysis. It generates the trunk of a binary HDT according to the binary information gain ratio criterion in an instance space defined by only original unordered attributes. If unordered attributes cannot further distinguish training examples falling into a leaf node whose diversity is beyond the diversity-threshold, then the node is marked as a dummy node. After all those dummy nodes are marked, a specific feedforward neural network named F annc  that is trained in an instance space defined by only original ordered attributes is exploited to accomplish the learning task. Moreover, this paper distinguishes three kinds of incremental learning tasks. Two incremental learning procedures designed for example-incremental learning with different storage requirements are provided, which enables HDT to deal gracefully with data sets where new data are frequently appended. Also a hypothesis-driven constructive induction mechanism is provided, which enables HDT to generate compact concept descriptions.",

To reduce the bias in label fusion, we proposed a joint label fusion technique to reduce correlated errors produced by different atlases via considering the pair-wise dependencies between them. Using image similarities from image patches to estimate the pairwise dependencies, we showed promising performance. To address the unreliability in purely using local image similarity for dependency estimation, we propose to improve the accuracy of the estimated dependencies by including empirical knowledge, which is learned from the atlases in a leave-one-out strategy.

    "abstract": "A ranging front end for low power cm-accurate ranging applications, based on an 8-channel Time-to-Digital converter, is presented. The implementation, fully digitizing pulses with a pulse rate up to 33MHz, contains 8 non-strobed comparators attached to an 8-channel, low power, 74ps resolution, 53ps single shot precision TDC-array, interconnected through 200mV low swing bit line signaling. The complete system consumes 4.7mW in active mode and the integrated TDC is competitive to state-of-the-art sub-100ps resolution multiple TDC-core integrations in terms of power per core and area. The complete pulse digitization enables implementation of a wide variety of time-of-arrival estimation techniques in the digital back end.",

    "abstract": "We consider an alternative expression of the Shapley value that reveals a system of compensations: each player receives an equal share of the worth of each coalition he belongs to, and has to compensate an equal share of the worth of any coalition he does not belong to. We give an interpretation in terms of formation of the grand coalition according to an ordering of the players and define the corresponding compensation vector. Then, we generalize this idea to cooperative games with a communication graph. Firstly, we consider cooperative games with a forest (cycle-free graph). We extend the compensation vector by considering all rooted spanning trees of the forest (see Demange 2004) instead of orderings of the players. The associated allocation rule, called the compensation solution, is characterized by component efficiency and relative fairness. The latter axiom takes into account the relative position of a player with respect to his component. Secondly, we consider cooperative games with arbitrary graphs and construct rooted spanning trees by using the classical algorithms DFS and BFS. If the graph is complete, we show that the compensation solutions associated with DFS and BFS coincide with the Shapley value and the equal surplus division respectively.",

    "abstract": "Background: Effective population management of patients with diabetes requires timely recognition. Current case-finding algorithms can accurately detect patients with diabetes, but lack real-time identification. We sought to develop and validate an automated, real-time diabetes case-finding algorithm to identify patients with diabetes at the earliest possible date. Methods: The source population included 160,872 unique patients from a large public hospital system between January 2009 and April 2011. A diabetes case-finding algorithm was iteratively derived using chart review and subsequently validated (n = 343) in a stratified random sample of patients, using data extracted from the electronic health records (EHR). A point-based algorithm using encounter diagnoses, clinical history, pharmacy data, and laboratory results was used to identify diabetes cases. The date when accumulated points reached a specified threshold equated to the diagnosis date. Physician chart review served as the gold standard. Results: The electronic model had a sensitivity of 97%, specificity of 90%, positive predictive value of 90%, and negative predictive value of 96% for the identification of patients with diabetes. The kappa score for agreement between the model and physician for the diagnosis date allowing for a 3-month delay was 0.97, where 78.4% of cases had exact agreement on the precise date. Conclusions: A diabetes case-finding algorithm using data exclusively extracted from a comprehensive EHR can accurately identify patients with diabetes at the earliest possible date within a healthcare system. The real-time capability may enable proactive disease management.",

    "abstract": "Abstract   Classifier design and performance validation are important steps in the development of computer-aided diagnosis (CAD) systems. Within a CAD system, one or more classifiers may be used at various stages to differentiate malignant and benign lesions, or to differentiate true lesions from false positives. A classifier is trained with case samples drawn from the patient population. The performance of the trained classifier on unknown samples depends on the quality (whether the training samples are statistically representative of the patient population) and the quantity (sample size) of the training samples. To evaluate the performance of the classifier (or the CAD system), an independent set of test samples that have not been seen by the classifier (unknown samples) should be used. Because the available samples with ground truth are often limited in medical imaging research, the finite sample size is a limiting factor in the development of CAD systems. In this talk, we will review some of the issues associated with classifier design and validation under the constraint of finite sample size.",

    "abstract": "It is known that latent semantic indexing (LSI) takes advantage of implicit higher-order (or latent) structure in the association of terms and documents. Higher-order relations in LSI capture \u201clatent semantics\u201d. These findings have inspired a novel Bayesian framework for classification named Higher-Order Naive Bayes (HONB), which was introduced previously, that can explicitly make use of these higher-order relations. In this paper, we present a novel semantic smoothing method named Higher-Order Smoothing (HOS) for the Naive Bayes algorithm. HOS is built on a similar graph based data representation of the HONB which allows semantics in higher-order paths to be exploited. We take the concept one step further in HOS and exploit the relationships between instances of different classes. As a result, we move beyond not only instance boundaries, but also class boundaries to exploit the latent information in higher-order paths. This approach improves the parameter estimation when dealing with insufficient labeled data. Results of our extensive experiments demonstrate the value of HOS on several benchmark datasets.",

Starting from a non-diagnosable labeled Petri net system, we present a systematic procedure to design a new labeling function that makes the system diagnosable and optimizes a given objective function. This procedure employs a particular net, called Verifier Net, that is built from the original Petri net and provides necessary and sufficient conditions for diagnosability. We exploit the system structure captured in the verifier net to guide the search for the desired new labeling function. The search is performed over an unfolding of the reachability/coverability tree of the verifier net and follows a set of rules that capture the relabeling strategy. We allow for unobservable transitions that cannot be labeled as well as for multiple fault classes. We formulate an integer linear programming problem that finds an optimal labeling function when numerical costs are associated with transition relabeling.",

    "abstract": "This paper presents a review of the literature on gamification design frameworks. Gamification, understood as the use of game design elements in other contexts for the purpose of engagement, has become a hot topic in the recent years. However, there's also a cautionary tale to be extracted from Gartner's reports on the topic: many gamification-based solutions fail because, mostly, they have been created on a whim, or mixing bits and pieces from game components, without a clear and formal design process. The application of a definite design framework aims to be a path to success. Therefore, before starting the gamification of a process, it is very important to know which frameworks or methods exist and their main characteristics. The present review synthesizes the process of gamification design for a successful engagement experience. This review categorizes existing approaches and provides an assessment of their main features, which may prove invaluable to developers of gamified solutions at different levels and scopes.",

An ultra-thin Ag 2 O film, used as an anode modification layer, has been employed on ITO surface through the UV-ozone treatment of Ag films. The insertion of this thin film with higher work function enhances the hole injection in the organic light-emitting diode and improves the performance of the devices effectively. The maximum electroluminescence (EL) efficiency of the device with the Ag 2 O film is 4.95 cd/A, it is about 60% higher than that of the device without it.",

    "abstract": "We define a general game which forms a basis for modelling situations of static search and concealment over regions with spatial structure. The game involves two players, the searching player and the concealing player, and is played over a metric space. Each player simultaneously chooses to deploy at a point in the space; the searching player receiving a payoff of 1 if his opponent lies within a predetermined radius r of his position, the concealing player receiving a payoff of 1 otherwise. The concepts of dominance and equivalence of strategies are examined in the context of this game, before focusing on the more specific case of the game played over a graph. Methods are presented to simplify the analysis of such games, both by means of the iterated elimination of dominated strategies and through consideration of automorphisms of the graph. Lower and upper bounds on the value of the game are presented and optimal mixed strategies are calculated for games played over a particular family of graphs.",

    "abstract": "In the system requirements phase, the non-functional requirements (NFR) are often captured only generically at a fairly high level, and they do not yet include the levels of detail necessary for the system engineers to allocate them as specific functionalities to be handled either by the software or the hardware, or a specific combination of the two. The European ECSS series of standards for the aerospace industry includes portability requirements as one of sixteen types of non functional requirements (NFR) for embedded and real-time software. A number of portability-related concepts are dispersed throughout the ECSS, IEEE-830, ISO 9126, ISO 24765, and ISO 2382-1 standards to describe, at varying levels of detail, the various types of candidate portability requirements at the system, software, and hardware levels. This paper organizes these dispersed portability concepts and terms into a standards-based reference framework of system portability requirements. The availability of this framework can facilitate the early identification and specification of the system portability NFR and their detailed allocation as specific portability functions to be handled by the specified allocation to hardware or software, or a specific combination of the two. The approach selected in this research for the structure of this reference framework is based on the generic model of software proposed in the COSMIC-ISO 19761 model, thereby allowing the functional size of the portability requirements allocated to software to be measured.",

However, it is important to make the walking machine terrain adaptive and versatile, and to minimize man's role as an operator in order to realize this potential. Terrain adaptive locomotion involves intelligent foothold selection and the control of gait to produce the desired motion. This requires a departure from the idealized, structured stepping patterns for statically stable gaits which have been the object of considerable research. A modified wave gait is used to demonstrate that it is possible for the vehicle velocity to be varied continuously in accordance with higher level commands even with irregular, asymmetric, and changing support patterns, A varying duty factor is employed to enable optimal leg cycling frequencies. Implementation of gait control algorithms and results from a computer simulation are also presented.",

    "abstract": "Three-dimensional (3-D) Otsu thresholding was regarded as an effective improvement over the original Otsu method, especially under low signal to noise ratio and poor contrast conditions. However, it is very time consuming for real-time applications. Shuffled frog-leaping algorithm (SFLA) is a newly developed memetic meta-heuristic evolutionary algorithm with good global search capability. In this paper, a fast threshold selection method based on SFLA is proposed to speed up the original 3-D Otsu thresholding for image segmentation. In this new paradigm, an updating rule is carefully designed to extend the length of each frog's jump by emulating frog's perception and action uncertainties. The modification widens the local search space thus helps to prevent premature convergence and improves the performance of the SFLA. It is then used to simplify the process for heuristic search of the optimal threshold instead of exhaustively exploring every possible threshold vector in three-dimensional space. Experimental results compared with the original 3-D Otsu and the fast recursive 3-D Otsu show that SFLA-based thresholding can exactly obtain the global optimal threshold with significant decrease in the computation time and the number of fitness function evaluation (FFE).",

    "abstract": "Motivated by the fact that important real-life problems, such as the protein docking problem, can be accurately modeled by minimizing a nonconvex piecewise-quadratic function, a nonconvex underestimator is constructed as the minimum of a finite number of strictly convex quadratic functions. The nonconvex underestimator is generated by minimizing a linear function on a reverse convex region and utilizes sample points from a given complex function to be minimized. The global solution of the piecewise-quadratic underestimator is known exactly and gives an approximation to the global minimum of the original function. Successive shrinking of the initial search region to which this procedure is applied leads to fairly accurate estimates, within 0.0060%, of the global minima of synthetic nonconvex functions for which the global minima are known. Furthermore, this process can approximate a nonconvex protein docking function global minimum within four-figure relative accuracy in six refinement steps. This is less than half the number of refinement steps required by previous models such as the convex kernel underestimator (Mangasarian et al., Computational Optimization and Applications, to appear) and produces higher accuracy here.",

Self-oscillation initially at around 4.5 THz excited by a dc-photo carrier component was reinforced by the photomixed differential-frequency excitation at 4.0 and 5.0 THz.

    "abstract": "Collaborations and collaboration uses are features new to UML 2.0. They possess many properties that support rapid and compositional service engineering. The notion of collaboration corresponds well with the notion of a service, and it seems promising to use them for service specification. We present an approach where collaborations are used to specify services, and show how collaborations enable high level feature composition by means of collaboration uses. We also show how service goals can be combined with behavior descriptions of collaborations to form what we call semantic interfaces. Semantic interfaces can be used to ensure compatibility when binding roles to classes and when composing systems from components. Various ways to compose collaboration behaviors are outlined and illustrated with telephony services.",

In this paper, many classes of three-weight cyclic codes over Fp are presented via an examination of the condition for the cyclic codes C(1,d) and C(1,e), which have parity-check polynomials m1(x)md(x) and m1(x)me(x) respectively, to have the same weight distribution, where mi(x) is the minimal polynomial of \u03c0 \u2212i over Fp for a primitive element \u03c0 of Fpm.

As an application, the value distribution of S(a, b, c) is utilized to investigate the weight distribution of the cyclic codes C(1,e,s) with parity-check polynomial m1(x)me(x)ms(x). In the case of p = 3 and even e satisfying the above condition, the duals of the cyclic code s C(1,e,s) have the optimal minimum distance.",

    "abstract": "In this paper, we propose a routing protocol for mobile ad hoc networks called Contact-based Hybrid Routing (CHR) protocol where each node maintains potential routes to the nodes which it encountered. Only one route request message is forwarded along the potential route maintained by the source to the destination. In forwarding the route request message, if an intermediate node finds that the potential route is broken, the node uses the potential route maintained by itself to the next node. Based on this idea, our goal is to reduce the number of route request messages by maintaining a small amount of information at the nodes. The experimental results in random way point mobility and disaster evacuation mobility have shown that CHR could reduce the number of messages while keeping reasonable accessibility to the destinations.",

    "abstract": "Past studies have found contradicting evidence regarding the influence of political discussion with disagreeing others on political participation. This study argues that the impact of discussion with disagreement is likely to depend on the type of participatory activities involved. It conceptualizes a distinction between position-taking and nonposition-taking activities. The former refers to activities designed to have potential participants taking up a set position on a specific matter, whereas the latter refers to activities not designed as such. It is argued that discussion with disagreeing others is likely to suppress participation in position-taking activities, since such activities leave lesser room for participants to express the complexities of and possible ambivalence in their views. In contrast, discussion with disagreeing others may encourage participation in nonposition-taking activities. Relevant hypotheses are tested with a survey conducted in Hong Kong examining the impact of discussion and...",

    "abstract": "We develop a new goodness-of-fit test for validating the performance of probability forecasts. Our test statistic is particularly powerful under sparseness and dependence in the observed data. To build our test statistic, we start from a formal definition of calibrated forecasts, which we operationalize by introducing two components. The first component tests the level of the estimated probabilities; the second validates the shape, measuring the differentiation between high and low probability events. After constructing test statistics for both level and shape, we provide a global goodness-of-fit statistic, which is asymptotically \u03c72 distributed. In a simulation exercise, we find that our approach is correctly sized and more powerful than alternative statistics. In particular, our shape statistic is significantly more powerful than the Kolmogorov--Smirnov test. Under independence, our global test has significantly greater power than the popular Hosmer--Lemeshow's \u03c72 test. Moreover, even under dependence, our global test remains correctly sized and consistent. As a timely and important empirical application of our method, we study the validation of a forecasting model for credit default events.#R##N##R##N#This paper was accepted by Wei Xiong, finance.",

This calls for efficient mining techniques for extracting useful information and knowledge from streams of data. In this paper, we propose a novel algorithm for stream mining of frequent itemsets in a limited memory environment. This algorithm uses a compact tree structure to capture important contents from streams of data. By exploiting its nice properties, such a tree structure can be easily maintained and can be used for mining frequent itemsets, as well as other patterns like constrained itemsets, even when the available memory space is small.",

    "abstract": "We address the problem of optimal downlink resource allocation in an OFDMA system, in a scenario where very limited channel quality information (CQI) is available at the base-station. Our work is particularly applicable in the context of the LTE downlink, since the feedback mechanism we consider closely resembles one of the CQI reporting modes in LTE. Specifically, the users only report the indices of their best M sub-bands and an effective CQI corresponding to these best M bands. Our policy simultaneously performs optimal sub-band assignment and rate allocation, by taking into account channel quality as well as the queue backlogs of each user. The technical novelty of our work lies in exploiting a limit theorem on the best SNRs reported by the users, and combining it within a Lyapunov stability framework. We show that our policy is throughput maximizing among all policies which are constrained to the CQI mechanism considered. Numerical results indicate that in terms of throughput and average delay, our policy compares favorably to existing resource allocation policies such as proportional fair.",

The hybrid algorithm was able to determine the structure and parameters of the wavelet neural network simultaneously. In this algorithm, adaptive crossover and mutation probability were used to accelerate the genetic speed and avoid the occurrence of prematurity. The modal frequencies of a glass/epoxy laminates beam with varying assumed delamination sizes and locations were computed using finite element method and fed into the wavelet neural network to predict the delamination location and its extent. The simulation demonstrates that the wavelet neural network based on hybrid hierarchy genetic algorithm is robust, promising and converges very fast.",

    "abstract": "This paper presents an approach for object recognition and shape retrieval in binary images. Object description is accomplished by contour and region-based solutions. Fusion of two categories of shape descriptors causes a considerable performance improvement in retrieval. In order to improve the recognition rate, it is important to extract the intrinsic object feature vectors in such a way that the geometrical distance between two such vectors matches the semantic relation between the two objects from which they were extracted. The main contribution in this paper is learning how to map the samples in high-dimensional observation space into the new manifold space so that the geometrically closer vectors belong to near semantics. Feature extraction is done by Isomap that belongs to a non-linear feature extraction algorithm. In the proposed method, the shortest path in the dissimilarity graph leads to less value between the samples in the same category by denoising the edge values. Experiments show that the geometrical distance between the samples on the manifold space are more compatible to the semantic distance of them. The proposed method has been compared to some well-known approaches by a variety of shape databases which includes MPEG-7 Part B, Kimia silhouettes, and Fish. The results show the effectiveness and validity of the method.",

    "abstract": "Altruism in social networks was traditionally considered based on user relationships and requirements. The capability of a user to help has seldom been taken into account while studying altruism. Also, to the best of our knowledge, no quantitative analysis has been made to determine the benefits of altruism. Here we quantitatively study the amount of altruism of users based on the help extended by users to each other and the benefits they reap because of being altruistic. Results indicate that a network in which 90 % users have capabilities that are above average contains 90 % altruistic users, while a network containing 50 % of users with above-average capabilities contains only 50 % altruistic users. Results also indicate that altruistic users (the good guys) reap more benefits than selfish users and free riders (i.e., finish first).",

Interactivity in relation to news is often seen as a way to give the consumer control over when to consume something and on which platform. Less attention has been placed on what should be consumed and how. Within the project MyNewsMyWay, a news service was constructed that makes possible a more in-depth and varied media consumption than what traditional news services offer today. In the follow-up design study OurNewsOurWays, additional attention was put on the possibility of combining professional news material with user-generated content.",

The approach is computationally fast and able to effectively remove undesirable noise while preserving prominent geometric features of a 3D mesh surface such as curved surface regions, sharp edges, and fine details. Extensive experimental results on various 3D models demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed iterative algorithm, which yields satisfactory output results in just one single iteration.",

Each of the Bluetooth devices in the connection state knows the access codes used in the ad-hoc networks, which is utilized as a reference signal for the parameter estimation. Also, the access correlation output can help the error correction schemes of the Bluetooth networks because the correlation output reflects the radio channel environments. The proposed estimators can be implemented without degradation of frame and spectral efficiency thanks to using the access code specified for the Bluetooth system.",

    "abstract": "We introduce a network creation game in which each player (vertex) has a fixed budget to establish links to other players. In this model, each link has a unit price, and each agent tries to minimize its cost, which is either its eccentricity or its total distance to other players in the underlying (undirected) graph of the created network. Two versions of the game are studied: In the MAX version, the cost incurred to a vertex is the maximum distance between the vertex and other vertices, and, in the SUM version, the cost incurred to a vertex is the sum of distances between the vertex and other vertices. We prove that in both versions pure Nash equilibria exist, but the problem of finding the best response of a vertex is NP-hard. We take the social cost of the created network to be its diameter, and next we study the maximum possible diameter of an equilibrium graph with  n  vertices in various cases. When the sum of players\u2019 budgets is  n  \u2212 1, the equilibrium graphs are always trees, and we prove that their maximum diameter is \u0398( n ) and \u0398(log\u2009 n ) in MAX and SUM versions, respectively. When each vertex has a unit budget (i.e., can establish a link to just one vertex), the diameter of any equilibrium graph in either version is \u0398(1). We give examples of equilibrium graphs in the MAX version, such that all vertices have positive budgets and yet the diameter is \u03a9(slog n ). This interesting (and perhaps counterintuitive) result shows that increasing the budgets may increase the diameter of equilibrium graphs and hence deteriorate the network structure. Then we prove that every equilibrium graph in the SUM version has diameter 2  O (slog n ) . Finally, we show that if the budget of each player is at least  k , then every equilibrium graph in the SUM version is  k -connected or has a diameter smaller than 4.",

    "abstract": "True random number generators (TRNGs) are the basic building blocks of cryptographic implementations. They are used to generate random numbers required for security protocols, to generate ephemeral keys, and are often used in hiding or masking countermeasures to thwart implementation attacks. The protection of TRNGs is an important issue to guarantee the security of cryptographic systems but less attention has been made in the past to evaluate the susceptibility of these building blocks against passive and active attacks. In this paper, we present active fault attacks on a recently proposed specific TRNG architecture presented by Cherkaoui  et al.  at CHES 2013. We successfully injected power and clock glitches in an FPGA implementation and elaborated the design in respect of thermo and underpowering attacks. Furthermore, we propose a method on how to reduce the susceptibility of these attacks to increase the resistance against fault attacks. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work that evaluates practical clock-glitch-based fault attacks on self-timed ring-based TRNGs.",

    "abstract": "Emotion-aware applications supporting natural interaction are currently still a vision. One difficulty in developing these applications is the lack of multimodal corpora suitable for multiple use contexts, such as public spaces. Here, we introduce ElectroEmotion, a research tool prototype for collecting vocal and gestural corpora in novel contexts collaboratively. ElectroEmotion concept includes a public walk-up-and-use interface that allows users to produce multimodal expressions in an interactive environment. We describe the design of this system and report an experimental study, which evaluated the importance of inducting emotion and social influences in corpus acquisition. This preliminary investigation involved 12 users. By performing a video-based interaction analysis, we found that the participants demonstrated spontaneous multimodal activity and more distinctively emotional expressions in response to the emotion induction procedure. Social learning through examples provided by the experimenter influenced the way the subjects interacted. From these observations, we believe that the proposed concept could be developed into a functional system that can help to produce emotional corpora.",

Programming models for these systems should take into formal consideration resources such as stack and heap. In this paper, we show how memory resource bounds can be inferred for assembly-level programs. Our inference process captures the memory needs of each method in terms of the symbolic values of its parameters. For better precision, we infer path-sensitive information through a novel guarded expression format. Our current proposal relies on a Presburger solver to capture memory requirements symbolically, and to perform fixpoint analysis for loops and recursion. Apart from safety in memory adequacy, our proposal can provide estimate on memory costs for embedded devices and improve performance via fewer runtime checks against memory bound.",

    "abstract": "Today, several costs caused by road traffic may either be only roughly approximated, or cannot be clearly assigned to the drivers causing them, or both. They are typically distributed evenly among a large fraction of drivers, which is both unfair and economically inefficient. We have built a prototypical platform, called the \u201cSmart Tachograph\u201d, that allows us to measure traffic-related costs on an individual basis, thus supporting a more fine-granular charging of the responsible parties. Sensors observe the manner and circumstances in which a vehicle is driven, while several accounting authorities can evaluate this information and charge motorists on a pay-per-use basis. The Smart Tachograph offers valuable insights for the deployment of future ubiquitous computing services in general: its implementation has obvious requirements in terms of security and privacy; its deployment model is realistic through the strong economic incentives it offers; and its usage directly affects core societal values such as fairness and trust. This paper summarizes our design considerations and discusses the feasibility and wider economic and societal implications of fielding such a system.",

    "abstract": "The integration of WiMAX and Mobile IPV6 (MIPV6) protocol is one of the hottest wireless network technology trends. HMIPV6 uses a Mobility Anchor Point (MAP) as the Local HA, to regionalize the handover operation, reduce lots of the Binding Update (BU) information transmission of MIPV6 among HA, CN and MN, and to achieve the goal of fast handover. However, the BU procedure of HMIPV6 consumes too much time and causes packet loss and transmission delay. Therefore, this paper proposes VMAP-C (VMAP with Caching) to improve the effectiveness and efficiency of handover. In this scheme, we use the original VMAP method to improve the performance of signal transmissions and also utilize caching scheme to replace the existing DAD mechanism. Then, we perform simulations with the NS-2 simulator tool, each VMAP is ranged from 4 to 8 ARs, and also the number of MN increases from 1 to 100. The final simulation results indicate that the proposed VMAP-C obtains a reduction of about 15.62-52.28% in Handover delay, decreases Jitter of arriving inter-packets by about 10.63-50.61%, enhances the Throughput of the system by about 6.56-12.63%, and reduces the Packet loss ratio by about 9.57-87.69% compared to VMAP. Consequently, we prove that the VMAP-C scheme can obtain lower delay, Jitter and Packet loss ratio more than VMAP, and achieve higher system Throughput and better handover performance on the HMIPV6 network.",

In this paper, we advance the science of inferring IPv4 address space utilization by proposing a novel taxonomy and analyzing and correlating results obtained through different types of measurements. We have previously studied an approach based on passive measurements that can reveal used portions of the address space unseen by active approaches. In this paper, we study such passive approaches in detail, extending our methodology to new types of vantage points and identifying traffic components that most significantly contribute to discovering used IPv4 network blocks. We then combine the results we obtained through passive measurements together with data from active measurement studies, as well as measurements from Border Gateway Protocol and additional data sets available to researchers. Through the analysis of this large collection of heterogeneous data sets, we substantially improve the state of the art in terms of: 1) understanding the challenges and opportunities in using passive and active techniques to study address utilization and 2) knowledge of the utilization of the IPv4 space.",

    "abstract": "Until now, routes evaluation for unmanned aerial vehicle still faces a variety of difficulties, which is due to the fact that during route evaluating, subjective judgments, quantitative data, and random information need to be considered simultaneously. In this paper, by formulating route evaluation as a multi-criteria decision making problem including uncertainties, an integrated route evaluation approach based on type-2 fuzzy sets is proposed. Firstly, a systemic evaluation framework that incorporates models for scoring evaluation criteria is proposed. Specifically, a survivability model incorporating dynamics and uncertainties in battlefield is developed, including some special features, such as calculating the probability of detecting, tracking, and destroying an unmanned aerial vehicle, and modeling the location of pop-up threats as a Markov chain. Then, type-2 fuzzy sets are introduced to represent linguistic values, managing linguistic uncertainty effectively and making the evaluation process realistic and reliable. Finally, the architecture of perceptual computer is extended, and the computing with words engine by means of linguistic weighted average method is adopted to obtain the overall score of each route, enabling both random and fuzzy uncertainties existing universally in the data to be effectively managed in a unified format. The proposed method has the advantages of diverse inputs such as numbers, probability distributions and words. All these can be aggregated to a final decision. Furthermore, it provides a useful tool to handle route evaluation problem in a highly reliable and intelligent manner, and it can be applied to solve multi-criteria decision making problems in many disciplines. Experimental results demonstrate the feasibility and effectiveness of our method.",

    "abstract": "We consider the problem of tracking with small relative error an integer function  f ( n ) defined by a distributed update stream  f '( n ) in the distributed monitoring model. In this model, there are  k  sites over which the updates  f '( n ) are distributed, and they must communicate with a central coordinator to maintain an estimate of  f ( n ).   Existing streaming algorithms with worst-case guarantees for this problem assume  f ( n ) to be monotone; there are very large lower bounds on the space requirements for summarizing a distributed non-monotonic stream, often linear in the size  n  of the stream. However, the input streams obtaining these lower bounds are highly variable, making relatively large jumps from one timestep to the next; in practice, the impact on  f ( n ) of any single update  f '( n ) is usually small. What has heretofore been lacking is a framework for non-monotonic streams that admits algorithms whose worst-case performance is as good as existing algorithms for monotone streams and degrades gracefully for non-monotonic streams as those streams vary more quickly.   In this paper we propose such a framework. We introduce a stream parameter, the \"variability\"  v , deriving its definition in a way that shows it to be a natural parameter to consider for non-monotonic streams. It is also a useful parameter. From a theoretical perspective, we can adapt existing algorithms for monotone streams to work for non-monotonic streams, with only minor modifications, in such a way that they reduce to the monotone case when the stream happens to be monotone, and in such a way that we can refine the worst-case communication bounds from \u03b8( n ) to O v . From a practical perspective, we demonstrate that  v  can be small in practice by proving that  v  is  O (log  f ( n )) for monotone streams and  o ( n ) for streams that are \"nearly\" monotone or that are generated by random walks. We expect  v  to be  o ( n ) for many other interesting input classes as well.",

    "abstract": "For the hydrogen economy to realize there will be a need for large-scale infrastructure investments. But with tremendous uncertainties surrounding the evolution of the future energy system it would be difficult to actually obtain these investments. In this paper we break this large-scale infrastructure problem into smaller parts and then tackle it. Also there is an opportunity to use the existing technologies as a bridge in the energy system transition -that would also spread the financial risks over time. This paper discusses two actionable solutions for implementing hydrogen economy in the Netherlands /sub i/ffering in the degree of impact (local vs. global) and type (application vs. infrastructure). The paper proposes breaking down this large-scale energy transition into smaller components; this could eventually provide opportunity for the use of strategic investment evaluation models such as real option to obtain investments for the energy infrastructure.",

    "abstract": "The design and implementation of a sparse matrix-matrix multiplication architecture on FPGAs is presented. Performance of the design, in terms of computational latency, as well as the associated power-delay and energy-delay tradeoff are studied. Taking advantage of the sparsity of the input matrices, the proposed design allows user-tunable power-delay and energy-delay tradeoffs by employing different number of processing elements (PEs) in the architecture design and different block size in the blocking decomposition. Such ability allows designers to employ different on-chip computational architecture for different system power-delay and energy-delay requirements. It is in contrast to conventional dense matrix-matrix multiplication architectures that always favor the maximum number of PEs and largest block size. In our implementation, the better energy consumption and power-delay product favors less PEs and smaller block size for the 90%-sparsity matrix-matrix multiplications. While in order to achieve better energy-delay product, more PEs and larger block size are preferred.",

    "abstract": "Researchers in the gait community propose various features, either appearance or model based, which they believe encode certain individual traits. One of the main assumptions made in many gait recognition techniques is constant walking-speed. Even though the gait patterns are repeatable, changes in walking speed can influence the gait patterns themselves. In this work we explore how changes in walking speed affect gait parameters in terms of recognition performance. A speed-varying walking database was collected to allow us to investigate and quantify the impact of speed on gait recognition methodically. We develop a normalization procedure, which maps gait features across speeds, and demonstrate their utility in previously proposed appearance-based gait recognition methods.",

    "abstract": "Adaptive neuro-fuzzy inference system (ANFIS) models are proposed as an alternative approach of evaporation estimation for Yuvacik Dam. This study has three objectives: (1) to develop ANFIS models to estimate daily pan evaporation from measured meteorological data; (2) to compare the ANFIS model to the multiple linear regression (MLR) model; and (3) to evaluate the potential of ANFIS model. Various combinations of daily meteorological data, namely air temperature, relative humidity, solar radiation and wind speed, are used as inputs to the ANFIS so as to evaluate the degree of effect of each of these variables on daily pan evaporation. The results of the ANFIS model are compared with MLR model. Mean square error, average absolute relative error and coefficient of determination statistics are used as comparison criteria for the evaluation of the model performances. The ANFIS technique whose inputs are solar radiation, air temperature, relative humidity and wind speed, gives mean square errors of 0.181mm, average absolute relative errors of 9.590%mm, and determination coefficient of 0.958 for Yuvacik Dam station, respectively. Based on the comparisons, it was found that the ANFIS technique could be employed successfully in modelling evaporation process from the available climatic data.",

    "abstract": "Automatic image tagging automatically assigns image with semantic keywords called tags, which significantly facilitates image search and organization. Most of present image tagging approaches assign the query image with the tags derived from the visually similar images in the training dataset only. However, their scalabilities and performances are constrained by the limitation of using the training method and the fixed size tag vocabulary. In this paper, we proposed a search based probabilistic image tagging algorithm (CTSTag), in which the initially assigned tags are mined from the content-based search result and expanded from the text-based search results. Experiments on NUS-WIDE dataset show not only the performance of the proposed algorithm but also the advantage of image retrieval using the tagging result.",

    "abstract": "The Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) has successfully operated onboard the Terra spacecraft for more than 12 years and the Aqua spacecraft for more than ten years. It has 20 reflective solar bands covering the visible (VIS), near infrared (NIR), and short-wave infrared (SWIR) spectral regions. They are calibrated on orbit using regularly scheduled solar diffuser measurements and lunar observations. In recent years, observations over selected ground targets are also used to monitor detector responses at different angles of incidence. This paper provides a brief description of MODIS on-orbit calibration and characterization methodologies and examines the calibration stability of the VIS, NIR, and SWIR spectral bands over the entire missions of both instruments. Results obtained from four different vicarious approaches (deserts, Dome Concordia, deep convective cloud, and simultaneous nadir overpass) show that Terra MODIS VIS and NIR spectral bands have a wavelength-dependent drift in reflectance with a drop up to 8% in the shortest wavelength region. All four approaches have a relative agreement to within 2.0% with an uncertainty of less than 1.5% for most bands. It is anticipated that the improvements made in the MODIS Collection 6, with additional corrections based on the desert reflectance trending results, will significantly reduce, if not completely remove, some of the trending drifts identified in the Collection-5 data product.",

It is based on hamming distance of sequences on receipt/loss of probe packets maintained at each pair of sibling nodes. With prior knowledge of multicast network topology, all lossy links can be effectively identified by our approach.",

    "abstract": "Traffic burstiness is known to be undesirable for a router as it increases the router's queue length and hence the queueing delays of data flows. This poses a security problem in which an attacker intentionally introduces traffic burstiness into routers. We consider a correlation attack, whose fundamental characteristic is to correlate multiple attack flows to generate synchronized small attack bursts, in an attempt to aggregate the bursts into a large burst at a target router.In this paper, we develop an analytical, fluid-based framework that models how the correlation attack disrupts router queues and how it can be mitigated. Using Poisson Counter Stochastic Differential Equations (PCSDEs), our framework captures the dynamics of a router queue for special cases and gives the closed-form average router queue length as a function of the inter-flow correlation. To mitigate the correlation attack, we apply our analytical framework to model different pacing schemes including Markov ON-OFF pacing and rate limiting, which are respectively designed to break down the inter-flow correlation and suppress the peak rates of bursts. We verify that our fluid models conform to packet-level ns2 simulation results.",

    "abstract": "An approach for the computation of the inverse dynamics of parallel manipulators is introduced. It is shown that, for this type of manipulator, the inverse kinematics and the inverse dynamics procedures can be easily parallelized. This leads to a closed-form efficient algorithm using n processors, where n is the number of kinematic chains connecting the base to the end-effector. The dynamics computations are based on the Newton-Euler formalism. The parallel algorithm arises from a judicious choice of the coordinate frames attached to each of the legs, which allows for the exploitation of the parallel nature of the mechanism itself. An example of the application of the algorithm to a spatial six-degree-of-freedom parallel manipulator is presented. >",

Although the literature contains many examples to tackle this problem, this solution can be considered innovative as it improves traditional laser-based systems. The proposed system is composed by two sub-systems. The first one is an obstacle detection system, which also allows the detection of hanging obstacles, within a 3D monitored area. This solution outperforms the original laser scanner based system used for safety which was limited to bi-dimensional areas only. Another vision system is used for tracking a guideline on the ground, that solves problems of localizations and drifts that sometimes can happen using the laser and vehicle odometry only. After a long testing phase, the system is actually installed in a modern industrial warehouse in Parma in order to finally estimate its robustness and reliability.",

    "abstract": "This paper presents a comprehensive study of continuous speech recognition in Spanish. It shows the use and optimisation of several well-known techniques together with the application for the first time to Spanish of language specific knowledge to these systems, i.e. the careful selection of the phone inventory, the phone-classes used, and the selection of alternative pronunciation rules. We have developed a semicontinuous phone-class dependent contextual modelling. Using four phone-classes, we have obtained recognition error rate reductions roughly equivalent to the percentage increase of the number of parameters, compared to baseline semicontinuous contextual modelling. We also show that the use of pausing in the training system and multiple pronunciations in the vocabulary help to improve recognition rates significantly. The actual pausing of the training sentences and the application of assimilation effects improve the transcription into context-dependent units. Multiple pronunciation possibilities are generated using general rules that are easily applied to any Spanish vocabulary. With all these ideas we have reduced the recognition errors of the baseline system by more than 30% in a task parallel to DARPA-RM translated into Spanish with a vocabulary of 979 words. Our database contains four speakers with 600 training sentences and 100 testing sentences each. All experiments have been carried out with a perplexity of 979, and even slightly higher in the case of multiple pronunciations, to be able to study the acoustic modelling power of the systems with no grammar constraints.",

This was the first study to use actual truck crash data collected directly from commercial truck fleets, representing a wide array of crashes. The study included data from 20 commercial truck fleets, including approximately 138,000 truck-years and more than 15,000 truck crashes, as they operated under real-world, revenue-producing deliveries. The findings showed strong positive benefits for speed limiters. Results indicated that trucks equipped without speed limiters had a significantly higher speed limiter-relevant crash rate (approximately 200%) compared to trucks with speed limiters.

    "abstract": "Clustering in very large databases or data warehouses, with many applications in areas such as spatial computation, web information collection, pattern recognition and economic analysis, is a huge task that challenges data mining researches. Current clustering methods always have the problems: 1) scanning the whole database leads to high I/O cost and expensive maintenance (e.g., R*-tree); 2) pre-specifying the uncertain parameter k, with which clustering can only be refined by trial and test many times; 3) lacking high efficiency in treating arbitrary shape under very large data set environment. In this paper, we first present a new hybrid-clustering algorithm to solve these problems. This new algorithm, which combines both distance and density strategies, can handle any arbitrary shape clusters effectively. It makes full use of statistics information in mining to reduce the time complexity greatly while keeping good clustering quality. Furthermore, this algorithm can easily eliminate noises and identify outliers. An experimental evaluation is performed on a spatial database with this method and other popular clustering algorithms (CURE and DBSCAN). The results show that our algorithm outperforms them in terms of efficiency and cost, and even gets much more speedup as the data size scales up much larger.",

    "abstract": "Background:   Many statistical and machine learning techniques have been implemented to build predictive fault models. Traditional methods are based on supervised learning. Software metrics for a module and corresponding fault information, available from previous projects, are used to train a fault prediction model. This approach calls for a large size of training data set and enables the development of effective fault prediction models. In practice, data collection costs, the lack of data from earlier projects or product versions may make large fault prediction training data set unattainable. Small size of the training set that may be available from the current project is known to deteriorate the performance of the fault predictive model. In semi-supervised learning approaches, software modules with known or unknown fault content can be used for training.     Aims:   To implement and evaluate a semi-supervised learning approach in software fault prediction.     Methods:   We investigate an iterative semi-supervised approach to software quality prediction in which a base supervised learner is used within a semi-supervised application.     Results:   We varied the size of labeled software modules from 2% to 50% of all the modules in the project. After tracking the performance of each iteration in the semi-supervised algorithm, we observe that semi-supervised learning improves fault prediction if the number of initially labeled software modules exceeds 5%.     Conclusion:   The semi-supervised approach outperforms the corresponding supervised learning approach when both use random forest as base classification algorithm.",

    "abstract": "We investigate ar ange ofmusic recommendation algorithm combinations, score aggregation functions, normalization techniques ,a nd late fusion techniques on approximately 200 million listening events col- lected through Last.fm. The overall goal is to identify superior combi- nations for the task of artist recommendation. Hypothesizing that user characteristics influence performance on these algorithmic combinations, we consider specific user groups determined by age, gender, country, and preferred genre. Overall, we find that the performance of music recom- mendation algorithms highly depends on user characteristics. Music recommendation within the field of recommender systems is becoming in- creasingly important since the advent of music streaming platforms that provide access to tens of millions of tracks. At the same time, listeners reveal a lot of personal information in social media, which might play an important role on the quality of music recommendations. However, the relationship between user characteristics and quality of music recommendations has not been thoroughly explored. In this paper, we provide an analysis of various combinations of rec- ommendation algorithms, score aggregation functions, normalization techniques, and late fusion techniques on a dataset of almost 200 million listening events from Last.fm. Hypothesizing that age, gender, country, and preferred genre in- fluence the quality of recommendations, we further group users according to these aspects and evaluate performance on the resulting user groups. This work is organized as follows. Section 2 overviews related work. In Sec- tions 3 and 4, we present the aspects we categorize users into and the recom- mendation models and settings we investigate, respectively. We introduce the dataset used for the experiments, explain the experimental setup, and analyze results in Section 5, before concluding in Section 6.",

    "abstract": "In 1926, Ernst Mally proposed a number of deontic postulates. He added them as axioms to classical propositional logic. The resulting system was unsatisfactory because it had the consequence that A is the case if and only if it is obligatory that A. We present an intuitionistic reformulation of Mally\u2019s deontic logic. We show that this system does not provide the just-mentioned objectionable theorem while most of the theorems that Mally considered acceptable are still derivable. The resulting system is unacceptable as a deontic logic, but it does make sense as a lax logic in the modern sense of the word.",

    "abstract": "One of the central issues in Learning to Rank (L2R) for Information Retrieval is to develop algorithms that construct ranking models by directly optimizing evaluation measures used in IR such as Precision at n, Mean Average Precision and Normalized Discounted Cumulative Gain. In this work we propose a new learning-to-rank method, referred as RankPSO. This algorithm is based on Particle Swarm Optimization. It builds a ranking model able to directly optimize evaluation measures used in Information Retrieval. To evaluate performance of RankPSO, we have compared it with other methods referenced in literature. We have carried out an experimental study using Letor OHSUMED dataset. The obtained results were analyzed statistically, demonstrating that RankPSO has significant improvement in precision compared to RankSVM, RankBoost and Regression methods; nevertheless, it does not have significant differences with AdaRank-MAP, AdaRank-NDCG, ListNet and FRank. The results show the advantages to use Particle Swarm Optimization as bio-inspired algorithm for learning to rank.",

Therefore, we present an efficient heuristic algorithm to generate low-power mapping solutions. The key idea is to compute and select low-power  K -feasible cuts by an efficient incremental network flow computation method. Experimental results show that our algorithm reduces power consumption as well as area over the best algorithms reported in the literature. In addition, we present an extension to compute depth-optimal low-power mappings. Compared with Cutmap, a depth-optimal mapper with simultaneous area minimization, we achieve a 14p power savings on average without any depth penalty.",

The problem is NP-hard and has applications, for example, in computer vision and in multistage production planning. We describe an algorithm which makes use of a mathematical programming solver in order to find near-optimal solutions to the problem both in acyclic directed graphs and in directed graphs possibly containing directed circuits. It is shown that the proposed technique compares favorably to competiting approaches published in the related literature. Moreover, the experimental evaluation demonstrates that, although mathematical programming solvers are very powerful for this problem, with growing graph size and density they become unpractical due to excessive memory requirements.",

The problem becomes more complex and challenging in case of HSI (Handwritten Script Identification). An automatic HSI technique for document images of six popular Indic scripts namely Bangla, Devanagari, Malayalam, Oriya, Roman and Urdu is proposed in this paper. A Block-level approach is followed for the same and initially 34-dimensional feature vector is constructed applying transform based (BRT, BDCT, BFFT and BDT), textural and statistical techniques. Finally using a GAS (Greedy Attribute Selection) method 20 attributes are selected for learning process. Total 600 unconstrained document image blocks of size 512\u00d7512 each, are prepared with equal distribution of each script type. The whole dataset is divided into 2:1 ratio for training and testing. Extensive experimentation is carried out for Six-scripts, Tetra-scripts, Tri-scripts and Bi-scripts combinations. Experimental result shows promising and comparable performance.",

    "abstract": "A numerical method is developed to solve the time-dependent Dirac equation in cylindrical coordinates for 3-D axisymmetric systems. The time evolution is treated by a splitting scheme in coordinate space using alternate direction iteration, while the wave function is discretized spatially on a uniform grid. The longitudinal coordinate evolution is performed exactly by the method of characteristics while the radial coordinates evolution uses Poisson's integral solution, which allows to implement the radial symmetry of the wave function. The latter is evaluated on a time staggered mesh by using Hermite polynomial interpolation and by performing the integration analytically. The cylindrical coordinate singularity problem at   r=0     r  =  0        is circumvented by this method as the integral is well-defined at the origin. The resulting scheme is reminiscent of non-standard finite differences. In the last step of the splitting, the remaining equation has a solution in terms of a time-ordered exponential, which is approximated to a higher order than the time evolution scheme. We study the time evolution of Gaussian wave packets, and we evaluate the eigenstates of hydrogen-like systems by using a spectral method. We compare the numerical results to analytical solutions to validate the method. In addition, we present three-dimensional simulations of relativistic laser\u2013matter interactions, using the Dirac equation.",

    "abstract": "Head pose estimation plays an essential role for bridging the information gap between humans and computers. Conventional head pose estimation methods are mostly done in images captured by cameras. However accurate and robust pose estimation is often problematic. In this paper we present an algorithm for recovering the six degrees of freedom (DOF) of motion of a head from a sequence of range images taken by the Microsoft Kinect for Xbox 360. The proposed algorithm utilizes a least-squares minimization of the difference between the measured rate of change of depth at a point and the rate predicted by the depth rate constraint equation. We segment the human head from its surroundings and background, and then we estimate the head motion. Our system has the capability to recover the six DOF of the head motion of multiple people in one image. The proposed system is evaluated in our lab and presents superior results.",

    "abstract": "Whenever a visualization researcher is asked about the purpose of visualization, the phrase \u201cgaining insight\u201d by and large pops out instinctively. However, it is not absolutely factual that all uses of visualization are for gaining a deep understanding, unless the term insight is broadened to encompass all types of thought. Even when insight is the focus of a visualization task, it is rather difficult to know what insight is gained, how much, or how accurate. In this paper, we propose that \u201csaving time\u201d in accomplishing a user\u2019s task is the most fundamental objective. By giving emphasis to saving time, we can establish a concrete metric, alleviate unnecessary contention caused by different interpretations of insight, and stimulate new research efforts in some aspects of visualization, such as empirical studies, design optimisation and theories of visualization. General Terms: Visualization Visualization was already an overloaded term, long before it has become a fashionable word in this era of data deluge. It may be used in the context of meditation as a means for creative imagination, or in sports as a means for creating a heightened sense of confidence. If we consider the term literally, as Robert Spence said, \u201cvisualization is solely a human cognitive activity and has nothing to do with computers\u201d [Spence 2007]. In this article, we focused on visualization in computing, which may be referred to technically as Computer-supported Data Visualization. In this context, the process of visualization features both data and computer. These two essential components differentiate this technological topic from those above-mentioned contexts. In the remainder of this article, we will simply refer to \u201ccomputer-supported data visualization\u201d as \u201cvisualization\u201d. Scott Owen [1999] compiled a collection of definitions and rationale for visualization, most of which are still widely adopted or adapted today. These definitions were intended to define the two questions, namely what is visualization and what is it for?",

    "abstract": "Mobile devices enable people to look for information at the moment when their information needs are triggered. While experiencing complex information needs that require multiple search sessions, users may utilize desktop computers to fulfill information needs started on mobile devices. Under the context of mobile-to-desktop web search, this article analyzes users\u2019 behavioral patterns and compares them to the patterns in desktop-to-desktop web search. Then, we examine several approaches of using Mobile Touch Interactions (MTIs) to infer relevant content so that such content can be used for supporting subsequent search queries on desktop computers. The experimental data used in this article was collected through a user study involving 24 participants and six properly designed cross-device web search tasks. Our experimental results show that (1) users\u2019 mobile-to-desktop search behaviors do significantly differ from desktop-to-desktop search behaviors in terms of information exploration, sense-making and repeated behaviors. (2) MTIs can be employed to predict the relevance of click-through documents, but applying document-level relevant content based on the predicted relevance does not improve search performance. (3) MTIs can also be used to identify the relevant text chunks at a fine-grained subdocument level. Such relevant information can achieve better search performance than the document-level relevant content. In addition, such subdocument relevant information can be combined with document-level relevance to further improve the search performance. However, the effectiveness of these methods relies on the sufficiency of click-through documents. (4) MTIs can also be obtained from the Search Engine Results Pages (SERPs). The subdocument feedbacks inferred from this set of MTIs even outperform the MTI-based subdocument feedback from the click-through documents.",

    "abstract": "One of the major outcomes of neuroscientific research are models of Neural Network Structures (NNSs). Descriptions of these models usually consist of a non-standardized mixture of text, figures, and other means of visual information communication in print media. However, as neuroscience is an interdisciplinary domain by nature, a standardized way of consistently representing models of NNSs is required. While generic descriptions of such models in textual form have recently been developed, a formalized way of schematically expressing them does not exist to date. Hence, in this paper we present Neural Schematics as a concept inspired by similar approaches from other disciplines for a generic two dimensional representation of said structures. After introducing NNSs in general, a set of current visualizations of models of NNSs is reviewed and analyzed for what information they convey and how their elements are rendered. This analysis then allows for the definition of general items and symbols to consistently represent these models as Neural Schematics on a two dimensional plane. We will illustrate the possibilities an agreed upon standard can yield on sampled diagrams transformed into Neural Schematics and an example application for the design and modeling of large-scale NNSs.",

    "abstract": "Safe data abstractions are widely used for verification purposes. Positive verification results can be transferred from the abstract to the concrete system. When a property is violated in the abstract system, one still has to check whether a concrete violation scenario exists. However, even when the violation scenario is not reproducible in the concrete system (a false negative), it may still contain information on possible sources of bugs.#R##N##R##N#Here, we propose a bug hunting framework based on abstract violation scenarios. We first extract a violation pattern from one abstract violation scenario. The violation pattern represents multiple abstract violation scenarios, increasing the chance that a corresponding concrete violation exists. Then, we look for a concrete violation that corresponds to the violation pattern by using constraint solving techniques. Finally, we define the class of counterexamples that we can handle and argue correctness of the proposed framework.#R##N##R##N#Our method combines two formal techniques, model checking and constraint solving. Through an analysis of contracting and precise abstractions, we are able to integrate overapproximation by abstraction with concrete counterexample generation.",

    "abstract": "This paper has a twofold purpose. First, to characterize the sustainability of the European wood manufacturing industry. In this way, a ranking of the European countries analyzed in terms of sustainability is established. To undertake this task the sustainability of each country is defined by using several indicators of diverse nature (economic, environmental and social). These indicators are aggregated into a composite or synthetic index with the help of a binary goal programming model. In this way, a ranking according to the sustainability of the wood manufacturing industry in the European countries studied is obtained. The second step in the research consists of explaining the causes behind the level of sustainability of each country. This task is carried out by taking the composite indexes of sustainability as endogenous variables and a tentative set of economic, environmental and social variables as explanatory variables. The link between endogenous and exogenous variables is made with the help of econometric models.",

    "abstract": "We have applied the k-nearest neighbor (kNN) modeling technique to the prediction of melting points. A data set of 4119 diverse organic molecules (data set 1) and an additional set of 277 drugs (data set 2) were used to compare performance in different regions of chemical space, and we investigated the influence of the number of nearest neighbors using different types of molecular descriptors. To compute the prediction on the basis of the melting temperatures of the nearest neighbors, we used four different methods (arithmetic and geometric average, inverse distance weighting, and exponential weighting), of which the exponential weighting scheme yielded the best results. We assessed our model via a 25-fold Monte Carlo cross-validation (with approximately 30% of the total data as a test set) and optimized it using a genetic algorithm. Predictions for drugs based on drugs (separate training and test sets each taken from data set 2) were found to be considerably better [root-mean-squared error (RMSE) = 46.3 \u00b0C, r 2  = 0.30] than those based on nondrugs (prediction of data set 2 based on the training set from data set 1, RMSE = 50.3 \u00b0C, r 2  = 0.20). The optimized model yields an average RMSE as low as 46.2 \u00b0C (r 2  = 0.49) for data set 1, and an average RMSE of 42.2 \u00b0C (r 2  = 0.42) for data set 2. It is shown that the kNN method inherently introduces a systematic error in melting point prediction. Much of the remaining error can be attributed to the lack of information about interactions in the liquid state, which are not well-captured by molecular descriptors.",

Through a down-sampling step, the non-primitive transfer function is decomposed into a sum of primitive transfer functions. A construction method for the positive realization of a primitive transfer function with multiple poles is proposed by using a regular polygon in the complex plane. A sufficient condition for the existence of the positive realization with an order bound is analyzed. Numerical examples are provided to demonstrate the efficiency of the proposed method for obtaining positive realizations.",

In the proposed approach, a best-fit curve is set as the detection threshold to separate moving targets from clutter and noise. A special technique, termed sliding-window technique, is then employed to reduce residual clutter and noise.

While traditional methods based on appearance fail in such challenging conditions, we exploit consistency in object motion between instances. Our approach discovers pairs of short video intervals where the object moves in a consistent manner and uses these candidates as seeds for spatial alignment. We model the spatial correspondence between the point trajectories on the object in one interval to those in the other using a time-varying Thin Plate Spline deformation model. On a large dataset of tiger and horse videos, our method automatically aligns thousands of pairs of frames to a high accuracy, and outperforms the popular SIFT Flow algorithm.",

We propose and evaluate different models and modeling strategies for 3D segmentation based on traditionalMarkov Random Fields (MRFs) and their discriminative counterparts known as Conditional Random Fields (CRFs). We also evaluate the utility of features based on histograms of oriented gradients or HOG features. CRFs and HOG features have independently produced state of the art performance in many other problem domains and we believe our work is the first to combine them and use them for medical image segmentation. We construct 3D lattice MRFs and CRFs, use variational message passing (VMP) for learning and max-product (MP) inference for prediction in the models. These inference and learning approaches allow us to learn pairwise terms in random fields that are non-submodular and are thus very flexible. We focus our experiments on abdominal organ and region segmentation, but our general approach should be useful in other settings. We evaluate our approach on a larger set of anatomical structures found within a publicly available liver database and we provide these labels for the dataset to the community for future research.",

    "abstract": "Traditional birdsong recognition approaches used acoustic features based on the acoustic model of speech production or the perceptual model of the human auditory system to identify the associated bird species. In this paper, a new feature descriptor that uses image shape features is proposed to identify bird species based on the recognition of fixed-duration birdsong segments where their corresponding spectrograms are viewed as gray-level images. The MPEG-7 angular radial transform (ART) descriptor, which can compactly and efficiently describe the gray-level variations within an image region in both angular and radial directions, will be employed to extract the shape features from the spectrogram image. To effectively capture both frequency and temporal variations within a birdsong segment using ART, a sector expansion algorithm is proposed to transform its spectrogram image into a corresponding sector image such that the frequency and temporal axes of the spectrogram image will align with the radial and angular directions of the ART basis functions, respectively. For the classification of 28 bird species using Gaussian mixture models (GMM), the best classification accuracy is 86.30% and 94.62% for 3-second and 5-second birdsong segments using the proposed ART descriptor, which is better than traditional descriptors such as LPCC, MFCC, and TDMFCC.",

The linear complementarity problem (abbreviated by LCP) is to find a vector (x, y) in R^(2n) satisfying y = Ax + b (x, y) >= 0 and the complementarity condition: xi yi = 0 for all i = 1 ,... , n. The LCP is known to be NP-complete, but there are some known classes of matrices A for which the LCP is polynomially solvable, for example the class of positive semi-definite (PSD-) matrices. In this paper, we study the LCP from the view point of EP (existentially polynomial time) theorems due to Cameron and Edmonds. In particular, we investigate the LCP duality theorem of Fukuda and Terlaky in EP form, and show that this immediately yields a simple modification of the criss- cross method with a nice practical feature. Namely, this algorithm can be applied to any given A and b, and terminates in one of the three states: (1) a solution x is found; (2) a solution to the dual LCP is found (implying the nonexistence of a solution to the LCP); or (3) a succinct certificate is given to show that the input matrix A is not \u201csufficient\u201d. Note that all PSD-matrices and P- matrices are sufficient matrices.",

    "abstract": "The Theory of Constraints (TOC) Simplified Drum-Buffer-Rope (SDBR) system works effectively in typical job shop environments. However, according to the experiences implementing SDBR system in local companies, such environments have the following characteristics, which may block SDBR implementation: (1) capacity constraint resources (CCR) is not always located in the middle of the routing as assumed in SDBR. The CCR can be located in either the front or back end of routing; (2) multiple or interactive CCRs can exist rather than the assumption of just one CCR; (3) order insertion, including urgent orders, change in due-date (especially bringing it forward) is common. Two ways may be applied to overcome these characteristics: (1) move back to a traditional DBR; (2) address problems through the buffer management process. However, both these ways have limitations and complexities. This paper presents an alternative method enhancing SDBR system performance. With the enhancement, we expect that SDBR can be adopted by more companies, especially those that have the same characteristics.",

    "abstract": "Separable Lyapunov functions play vital roles, for example, in stability analysis of large-scale systems. A Lyapunov function is called max-separable if it can be decomposed into a maximum of functions with one-dimensional arguments. Similarly, it is called sum-separable if it is a sum of such functions. In this paper it is shown that for a monotone system on a compact state space, asymptotic stability implies existence of a max-separable Lyapunov function. We also construct two systems on a non-compact state space, for which a max-separable Lyapunov function does not exist. One of them has a sum-separable Lyapunov function. The other does not.",

    "abstract": "Abstract: Current UML based behavioral requirements focus on the specification of use cases. Business rules are seen as a very important part of the requirements but are either considered as a separate entity or, at best, attached to use cases. Some authors have recognized the need to include business rules within use cases but there are no concrete guidelines on how to do it. In this paper we propose a technique that uses business rules as the driving mechanism behind the design process. By explicitly defining business rules in collaborations of a group of actors, we are able to find the policies governing the behavior of the different actors involved. When we decide to consider one of these actors as the system to be designed, these policies enable us to define the goals of this system. These goals are implemented as use cases which themselves are governed by business rules for the system. When considering this system as a set of parts we loop back to the beginning of our process but at a different organizational level.",

    "abstract": "End-users utilize chemical search engines to search for chemical formulae and chemical names. Chemical search engines identify and index chemical formulae and chemical names appearing in text documents to support efficient search and retrieval in the future. Identifying chemical formulae and chemical names in text automatically has been a hard problem that has met with varying degrees of success in the past. We propose algorithms for chemical formula and chemical name tagging using Conditional Random Fields (CRFs) and Support Vector Machines (SVMs) that achieve higher accuracy than existing (published) methods. After chemical entities have been identified in text documents, they must be indexed. In order to support user-provided search queries that require a partial match between the chemical name segment used as a keyword or a partial chemical formula, all possible (or a significant number of) subformulae of formulae that appear in any document and all possible subterms (e.g., \u201cmethyl\u201d) of chemical names (e.g., \u201cmethylethyl ketone\u201d) must be indexed. Indexing all possible subformulae and subterms results in an exponential increase in the storage and memory requirements as well as the time taken to process the indices. We propose techniques to prune the indices significantly without reducing the quality of the returned results significantly. Finally, we propose multiple query semantics to allow users to pose different types of partial search queries for chemical entities. We demonstrate empirically that our search engines improve the relevance of the returned results for search queries involving chemical entities.",

We introduce a data-driven, probabilistic model that maps received signal strength (RSS) values to real-world distance distributions and embed this model in a grid-based localization algorithm that successfully performs the LANdroids tethering task. We furthermore show, that it is possible to improve localization through the addition of a compass sensor and inter-robot information sharing.",

    "abstract": "This paper presents a versatile image recognition method, combining conventional pattern matching and a learning system. The proposed system first quickly determines candidate regions containing the target object in the image, and then examines the result by using the learning system. In the pattern matching, \u201cactive search\u201d is used, which quickly extracts the target object using multiple two-dimensional reference images. As a learning system, an adaptive fuzzy inference neural network (AFINN) is used, which can perform knowledge processing. The AFINN automatically constructs the inference model, such as the selection of the necessary input information, and automatically acquires the inference rules through learning. Consequently, by applying the AFINN to the image recognition problem, highly versatile object recognition is realized without requiring explicit knowledge for recognition. The proposed system can be applied to a wide range of problems, since diversified objects can be recognized by simply modifying the registered reference images. In this paper, the method is applied to a sample problem, consisting of an image of the laboratory containing various objects, such as computers, monitors, and chairs, and it is verified that high recognition accuracy can be realized. \u00a9 2006 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

    "abstract": "Adaptation to the characteristics of specific images and the preferences of individual users is critical to the success of an image retrieval system but insufficiently addressed by the existing approaches. In this paper, we propose an elegant and effective approach to data-adaptive and user-adaptive image retrieval based on the idea of peer indexing\u2014describing an image through semantically relevant peer images. Specifically, we associate each image with a two-level peer index that models the \u201cdata characteristics\u201d of the image as well as the \u201cuser characteristics\u201d of individual users with respect to this image. Based on two-level image peer indexes, a set of retrieval parameters including query vectors and similarity metric are optimized towards both data and user characteristics by applying the pseudo feedback strategy. A cooperative framework is proposed under which peer indexes and image visual features are integrated to facilitate data- and user-adaptive image retrieval. Simulation experiments conducted on real-world images have verified the effectiveness of our approach in a relatively restricted setting.",

Modeling the nodes of the network as energy sellers, we can derive the optimal power allocation solution between the source node and the relay node by graphic method intuitively and select the optimal relay node according to minimum cost (MIC) criteria. Simulation results show that the lifetime of the cooperative network can be significantly prolonged using the proposed scheme compared with other schemes.",

    "abstract": "Identification of continuous-time AR processes by least squares and instrumental variables methods using discrete-time data in a \u2018direct approach\u2019 is considered. The derivatives are substituted by discrete-time differences, for example by replacing differentiation by a delta operator. In this fashion the model is casted into a (discrete-time) linear regression. In earlier work we gave sufficient conditions for the estimates to be close to their true values for large data sets and small sampling intervals. The purpose of this paper is to further analyse the statistical properties of the parameter estimates. We give expressions for the dominating bias term of the estimates, for a general linear estimator applied to the continuous-time autoregressive process. Further, we consider the asymptotic distribution of the estimates. It turns out to be Gaussian, and we characterise its covariance matrix, which has a simple form.",

    "abstract": "Centuries ago, the existence of life was explained by the presence of a soul (Tylor, 1871). Known as animism, this term was re-defined in the 1970s by Piaget as young children's beliefs that inanimate objects are capable of actions and have life-like qualities. With the development of robots in the 21st century, researchers have begun examining whether animism is apparent in children's impressions of robots. The purpose of this study was to use a model of knowledge structures, or schemata, to examine whether children attribute human qualities of cognition, affect, and behavior to a robot. An experiment was set up at a science center located in a major Western Canadian city, and visitors to the center were invited to participate. A total of 198 children ages 5-16 years (M=8.18 years) with an approximate even number of boys and girls were included. Children completed a semi-structured interview after observing a robot, a small 5 degree of freedom robot arm, perform a block stacking task. Answers to the nine questions about the robot were scored according to whether they referenced humanistic qualities. Results from frequency and content analyses suggest that a significant proportion of children ascribe cognitive, behavioral, and especially affective, characteristics to robots.",

    "abstract": "An enhanced concept of sub-optimal reverse Horn fraction of a CNF-formula was introduced in [18]. It was shown that this fraction is very useful in effectively (almost) separating 3-colorable random graphs with fixed node-edge density from the non-3-colorable ones. A correlation between this enhanced sub-optimal reverse Horn fraction and satisfiability of random 3-SAT instances with a fixed density was observed. In this paper, we present experimental evidence that this correlation scales to larger-sized instances and that it extends to solver performances as well, both of complete and incomplete solvers. Furthermore, we give a motivation for various phases in the algorithm aHS, establishing the enhanced sub-optimal reverse Horn fraction, and we present clear evidence for the fact that the observed correlations are stronger than correlations between satisfiability and sub-optimal MAXSAT-fractions established similarly to the enhanced sub-optimal reverse Horn fraction. The latter observation is noteworthy because the correlation between satisfiability and the optimal MAXSAT-fraction is obviously 100%.",

    "abstract": "This paper proposes a multicast scheme for the packet forwarding mechanism in the Universal Mobile Telecommunications System (UMTS). The scheme relies on the introduction of the Permanent Multicast Routing List (PMRL) and Temporary Multicast Routing List (TMRL) in each node of the network except UEs. In the PMRL we record the nodes of the next level that the messages for every multicast group should be forwarded. The TMRL is useful for the temporary record of information from the path from the mobile users to the GGSN. Additionally, a Multicast Group List (MGL) is kept in the GGSN which records the members of each multicast group. These lists lead to the decrement of the transmitted packets and the more efficient use of the network resources in the multicast routing in UMTS. We analyze the exact steps that the multicast packets are transmitted to the members of each multicast group. Furthermore, special issues such as joining/leaving a multicast service are described",

    "abstract": "Useful field of view, a measure of processing speed and spatial attention, can be improved with training. We evaluated the effects of this improvement on older adults' driving performance. Elderly adults participated in a speed-of-processing training program (N = 48), a traditional driver training program performed in a driving simulator (N = 22), or a low-risk reference group (N = 25). Before training, immediately after training or an equivalent time delay, and after an 18-month delay each participant was evaluated in a driving simulator and completed a 14-mile (22.5-km) open-road driving evaluation. Speed-of-processing training, but not simulator training, improved a specific measure of useful field of view (UFOV), transferred to some simulator measures, and resulted in fewer dangerous maneuvers during the driving evaluation. The simulator-trained group improved on two driving performance measures: turning into the correct lane and proper signal use. Similar effects were not observed in the speed-of-processing training or low-risk reference groups. The persistence of these effects over an 18-month test interval was also evaluated. Actual or potential applications of this research include driver assessment and/or training programs and cognitive intervention programs for older adults.",

    "abstract": "A Goldschmidt iterative divider for quantum-dot cellular automata (QCA) is designed using a new architecture that solves a problem that arises in implementing conventional state machines in QCA. State machines for QCA often have synchronization problems due to the long delays between the state machines and the units (i.e., the computational circuits) to be controlled. To resolve this problem, a data tag method is used. The data tags are associated with the data and local tag decoders generate control signals. Since each datum has a tag, it is possible to issue a new division command at any iteration stage of a previous issued operation. Thus the throughput is significantly increased since multiple division computations can be performed in a time skewed manner using one iterative divider due to the large number of inherent pipeline stages in QCA circuits (unlike CMOS circuits). Using the new architecture, a fixed-point Goldschmidt divider is implemented using a 12-bit multiplier.",

    "abstract": "Robotic Development Environments (RDEs) have come to play an increasingly important role in robotics research in general, and for the development of architectures for mobile robots in particular. Yet, no systematic evaluation of available RDEs has been performed; establishing a comprehensive list of evaluation criteria targeted at robotics applications is desirable that can subsequently be used to compare their strengths and weaknesses. Moreover, there are no practical evaluations of the usability and impact of a large selection of RDEs that provides researchers with the information necessary to select an RDE most suited to their needs, nor identifies trends in RDE research that suggest directions for future RDE development.#R##N##R##N#This survey addresses the above by selecting and describing nine open source, freely available RDEs for mobile robots, evaluating and comparing them from various points of view. First, based on previous work concerning agent systems, a conceptual framework of four broad categories is established, encompassing the characteristics and capabilities that an RDE supports. Then, a practical evaluation of RDE usability in designing, implementing, and executing robot architectures is presented. Finally, the impact of specific RDEs on the field of robotics is addressed by providing a list of published applications and research projects that give concrete examples of areas in which systems have been used. The comprehensive evaluation and comparison of the nine RDEs concludes with suggestions of how to use the results of this survey and a brief discussion of future trends in RDE design.",

In a possible mission scenario, one of the vehicles acts a leader and follows a path accurately, while the other vehicles follow paths that are naturally determined by the formation pattern imposed. The paper solves this and other related problems using a simple algorithm that builds on linearization techniques and gain scheduling control theory. Using this set-up, path following (in space) and inter-vehicle coordination (in time) are almost decoupled. Path following for each vehicle amounts to reducing a conveniently defined generalized error vector to zero. Vehicle coordination is achieved by adjusting the speed of each of the vehicles along its path, according to information on the position of all or some of the other vehicles. No other in...",

    "abstract": "We study an energy functional for computing optical flow that com- bines three assumptions: a brightness constancy assumption, a gradient constancy assumption, and a discontinuity-preserving spatio-temporal smoothness constraint. In order to allow for large displacements, linearisations in the two data terms are strictly avoided. We present a consistent numerical scheme based on two nested fixed point iterations. By proving that this scheme implements a coarse-to-fine warping strategy, we give a theoretical foundation for warping which has been used on a mainly experimental basis so far. Our evaluation demonstrates that the novel method gives significantly smaller angular errors than previous techniques for optical flow estimation. We show that it is fairly insensitive to parameter vari- ations, and we demonstrate its excellent robustness under noise.",

    "abstract": "Recent indirect experimental evidence suggests that synaptic plasticity changes along the dendrites of a neuron. Here we present a synaptic plasticity rule which is controlled by the properties of the pre- and postsynaptic signals. Using recorded membrane traces of back-propagating and dendritic spikes we demonstrate that LTP and LTD will depend specifically on the shape of the postsynaptic depolarization at a given dendritic site. We find that asymmetrical spike-timing-dependent plasticity (STDP) can be replaced by temporally symmetrical plasticity within physiologically relevant time windows if the postsynaptic depolarization rises shallow. Presynaptically the rule depends on the NMDA channel characteristic, and the model predicts that an increase in Mg2+ will attenuate the STDP curve without changing its shape. Furthermore, the model suggests that the profile of LTD should be governed by the postsynaptic signal while that of LTP mainly depends on the presynaptic signal shape.",

The new challenges in these data need fast and online data processing, especially in classification problems. One of the most challenging problems in field of data streams that reduces the performance of traditional methods is concept change. To handle this problem, it is necessary to update the classifier system after every alteration of the concept of data. However, updating a classifier can often be a time consuming and expensive process. In this paper, an efficient method is proposed for quickly and easily updating of a fuzzy rule-based classifier by setting a weight for each rule. Then, two online procedures for online adjustment of the rule weights are proposed. The experimental results show the high performance of these methods against a non-weighted approach.",

    "abstract": "We have previously shown that hemispherical soft fingertips are at equilibrium when they are in contact with objects, suggesting that the contact force and flexibility of these soft fingertips are important for stable grasping and manipulation. Hence, by making use of these characteristics, soft fingers can manipulate objects dexterously. While our previous work has focused on pairs of 1-DOF fingers with soft fingertips, we present here a control scheme by which a pair of 2-DOF soft fingers can control a grasped object's planar location. This new control scheme consists of a proportional controller of finger joint angles and an integral controller of object location. We subsequently describe our formulation of the equations of motion of manipulations performed by a pair of 2-DOF soft fingertips. We then apply this control scheme to an experimental situation and to a simulation based on a parallel distributed virtual spring model to control the planar location of a grasped object. These findings demonstrate the validity of the proposed scheme. Finally, we show that extending the theory of the proposed controller can lead to the control of grasping forces.",

    "abstract": "Imaging is often used for the purpose of estimating the value of some parameter of interest. For example, a cardiologist may measure the ejection fraction (EF) of the heart in order to know how much blood is being pumped out of the heart on each stroke. In clinical practice, however, it is difficult to evaluate an estimation method because the gold standard is not known, e.g., a cardiologist does not know the true EF of a patient. Thus, researchers have often evaluated an estimation method by plotting its results against the results of another (more accepted) estimation method, which amounts to using one set of estimates as the pseudogold standard. In this paper, we present a maximum-likelihood approach for evaluating and comparing different estimation methods without the use of a gold standard with specific emphasis on the problem of evaluating EF estimation methods. Results of numerous simulation studies will be presented and indicate that the method can precisely and accurately estimate the parameters of a regression line without a gold standard, i.e., without the x axis.",

An important part of this process has been the collection of telephone speech which was used for training and evaluation. In the first phase of data collection our goal was to collect read speech from a wide variety of talkers, telephone handsets, and noise/channel conditions. In the second phase of data collection our additional goal was to collect spontaneous telephone speech from subjects actually using the system. In order to maximize variation in telephone conditions, as well as ease of use for subjects, the data collection software was designed to telephone subjects at their specified phone numbers around North America. Subjects initiate the data collection session by submitting an electronic form accessible by a WWW browser. For read speech collection, a set of prompts is automatically generated for the subject. This paper describes the design of the data collection system we are using for these purposes. To date we have collected over 9,000 utterances from over 270 subjects.",

An important assumption of traditional DBN structure learning is that the data are generated by a stationary process, an assumption that is not true in many important settings. In this paper, we introduce a new class of graphical model called a non-stationary dynamic Bayesian network, in which the conditional dependence structure of the underlying data-generation process is permitted to change over time. Non-stationary dynamic Bayesian networks represent a new framework for studying problems in which the structure of a network is evolving over time. Some examples of evolving networks are transcriptional regulatory networks during an organism's development, neural pathways during learning, and traffic patterns during the day. We define the non-stationary DBN model, present an MCMC sampling algorithm for learning the structure of the model from time-series data under different assumptions, and demonstrate the effectiveness of the algorithm on both simulated and biological data.",

With this criterion, we establish non complete integrability for the  magnetic  satellite  with axial symmetry , except for a particular family  F  already found in [11], and for the satellite  without axial symmetry .

    "abstract": "In real audio data, frequently occurring patterns often convey relevant information on the overall content of the data. The possibility to extract meaningful portions of the main content by identifying such key patterns, can be exploited for providing audio summaries and speeding up the access to relevant parts of the data. We refer to these patterns as audio motifs in analogy with the nomenclature in its counterpart task in biology. We describe a framework for the discovery of audio motifs in streams in an unsupervised fashion, as no acoustic or linguistic models are used. We define the fundamental problem by decomposing the overall task into elementary subtasks; then we propose a solution that combines a one-pass strategy that exploits the local repetitiveness of motifs and a dynamic programming technique to detect repetitions in audio streams. Results of an experiment on a radio broadcast show are shown to illustrate the effectiveness of the technique in providing audio summaries of real data.",

To illustrate this, we have simulated a movie-on-demand service using our generic multimedia-on-demand simulation model. We have demonstrated the real-time nature, scalability and cost-effectiveness of a movie-on-demand system based upon our generic multimedia-on-demand system.

    "abstract": "The design of new quantum algorithms has proven to be an extremely difficult task. This paper considers a different approach to the problem, by studying the problem of 'quantum state generation'.We first show that any problem in Statistical Zero Knowledge (including eg. discrete log, quadratic residuosity and gap closest vector in a lattice) can be reduced to an instance of the quantum state generation problem. Having shown the generality of the state generation problem, we set the foundations for a new paradigm for quantum state generation. We define 'Adiabatic State Generation' (ASG), which is based on Hamiltonians instead of unitary gates. We develop tools for ASG including a very general method for implementing Hamiltonians (The sparse Hamiltonian lemma), and ways to guarantee non negligible spectral gaps (The jagged adiabatic path lemma). We also prove that ASG is equivalent in power to state generation in the standard quantum model. After setting the foundations for ASG, we show how to apply our techniques to generate interesting superpositions related to Markov chains.The ASG approach to quantum algorithms provides intriguing links between quantum computation and many different areas: the analysis of spectral gaps and groundstates of Hamiltonians in physics, rapidly mixing Markov chains, statistical zero knowledge, and quantum random walks. We hope that these links will bring new insights and methods into quantum algorithms.",

    "abstract": "This paper presents a stereo matching algorithm using the dynamic programming technique. The stereo matching problem, that is, obtaining a correspondence between right and left images, can be cast as a search problem. When a pair of stereo images is rectified, pairs of corresponding points can be searched for within the same scanlines. We call this search intra-scanline search. This intra-scanline search can be treated as the problem of finding a matching path on a two-dimensional (2D) search plane whose axes are the right and left scanlines. Vertically connected edges in the images provide consistency constraints across the 2D search planes. Inter-scanline search in a three-dimensional (3D) search space, which is a stack of the 2D search planes, is needed to utilize this constraint. Our stereo matching algorithm uses edge-delimited intervals as elements to be matched, and employs the above mentioned two searches: one is inter-scanline search for possible correspondences of connected edges in right and left images and the other is intra-scanline search for correspondences of edge-delimited intervals on each scanline pair. Dynamic programming is used for both searches which proceed simultaneously: the former supplies the consistency constraint to the latter while the latter supplies the matching score to the former. An interval-based similarity metric is used to compute the score. The algorithm has been tested with different types of images including urban aerial images, synthesized images, and block scenes, and its computational requirement has been discussed.",

    "abstract": "A nonlinear compensation method for matrix converter is proposed to compensate the voltage error between the reference voltage and actual output voltage. The output voltage error caused by voltage-based commutation process is analyzed, and the parasitic capacitor effect of the matrix converter on a forced commutation process is investigated. It is found that the parasitic capacitor effect could reduce the total output voltage error caused by the commutation process, and it makes the output voltage error relate to not only the direction of the load current but also the magnitude of the load current. The voltage error caused by the voltage-based commutation process is obtained considering the switching pattern, and then, the general function of the total voltage error is obtained considering the on-state voltage drop of the switching devices. The effectiveness of the compensation method has been verified by passive  R  - L  load experiments and induction motor vector control experiments.",

    "abstract": "Carneades is a recently proposed formalism for structured argumentation with varying proof standards, inspired by legal reasoning, but more generally applicable. Its distinctive feature is that each statement can be given its own proof standard, which is claimed to allow a more natural account of reasoning under burden of proof than existing formalisms for structured argumentation, in which proof standards are defined globally. In this article, the two formalisms are formally related by translating Carneades into the ASPIC+ framework for structured argumentation. Since ASPIC+ is defined to generate Dung-style abstract argumentation frameworks, this in effect translates Carneades graphs into abstract argumentation frameworks. For this translation, we prove a formal correspondence and show that certain rationality postulates hold. It is furthermore proved that Carneades always induces a unique Dung extension, which is the same in all of Dung's semantics, allowing us to generalise Carneades to cycle-containi...",

    "abstract": "Optimal channel switching and detector design is studied for M-ary communication systems in the presence of stochastic signaling, which facilitates randomization of signal values transmitted for each information symbol. Considering the presence of multiple additive noise channels (which can have non-Gaussian distributions in general) between a transmitter and a receiver, the joint optimization of the channel switching (timesharing) strategy, stochastic signals, and detectors is performed in order to achieve the minimum average probability of error. It is proved that the optimal solution to this problem corresponds to either (i) switching between at most two channels with deterministic signaling over each channel, or (ii) time-sharing between at most two different signals over a single channel (i.e., stochastic signaling over a single channel). For both cases, the optimal solutions are shown to employ corresponding maximum a posteriori probability (MAP) detectors at the receiver. Numerical results are presented to investigate the proposed approach.",

    "abstract": "In this paper we propose a new clustering framework for transactional data-sets involving large numbers of customers and products. Such transactional data pose particular issues such as very high dimensionality (greater than 10,000), and sparse categorical entries, that have been dealt with more effectively using a graph-based approach to clustering such as ROCK. But large transactional data raises certain other issues such as how to compare diverse products (e.g. milk vs. cars) cluster balancing and outlier removal, that need to be addressed. We first propose a new similarity measure that takes the value of the goods purchased into account, and form a value-based graph representation based on this similarity measure. A novel value-based balancing criterion that allows the user to control the balancing of clusters, is then defined. This balancing criterion is integrated with a value-based goodness measure for merging two clusters in an agglomerative clustering routine. Since graph-based clustering algorithms are very sensitive to outliers, we also propose a fast, effective and simple outlier detection and removal method based on under-clustering or over- partitioning. The performance of the proposed clustering framework is compared with leading graph-theoretic approaches such as ROCK and METIS.\u00a9 (2001) COPYRIGHT SPIE--The International Society for Optical Engineering.

    "abstract": "Wind power farm monitoring has been received a great attention in both academia and industry with increasing demand for better and reliable communications network. This paper develops a communication network simulator for wind power farm based on switched Gigabit Ethernet. The proposed network model offers remote monitoring for five different sub-networks inside wind turbine (WT) tower: analogue measurement, status information, protection and control devices, video surveillance and internet connection. Architectures and measurement requirements for different sub-networks are explained and discussed. To evaluate the performance of wind power farm network, a small scale wind farm with switched Gigabit Ethernet is modeled and simulated by OPNET modeler. Simulation results show that the proposed network model satisfies with the requirements of power system.",

    "abstract": "E-mail is one of the most successful computer applications ever developed. Despite its success, it is now dogged by numerous problems. Users complain about feeling overwhelmed by the volume of messages they receive, they have difficulties too in organizing and managing their e-mail data but, most importantly, they have problems in using e-mail to manage collaborative tasks (Bellotti, Ducheneaut, Howard, & Smith, 2003; Balter, 1998, 2000; Mackay, 1988; Whittaker, Jones, & Terveen, 2002a; Whittaker & Sidner, 1996). These require extended interaction with others for their definition and execution (Bellotti et al., 2003; Venolia, Gupta, Cadiz, & Dabbish, 2001; Whittaker & Sidner, 1996). As a result, users are often concurrently working on multiple outstanding tasks as they await responses from others concerning these tasks. This requires users to (a) create reminders, (b) identify messages that relate to the same task, and (c) combine information from these related messages. Currently, people try to use the email inbox to do this but our data indicate it is ineffective for these purposes. Other recent approaches attempt to tackle Collaborative Task Management but we show that these offer at best only partial solutions. In contrast, we present two systems, TeleNotes and ContactMap, that directly address Collaborative Task Management. These are motivated by empirical research into paper-based and people-based task management strategies. We describe how our systems implement these different strategies and present evaluation data for each system in use. We contrast the success of these two approaches with earlier work and discuss outstanding design and theory problems arising from our research.",

In this paper, we (1) give a necessary and sufficient condition that decides, using only the sequences  seq , whether  seq ( R  0 ) is irreversible or not; (2) give the algorithm  test , which implements the condition in (1) in  O ( n  8 ) time, where  n  is the length of the sequence  seq ; (3) give a set of sound and complete axioms (i.e., inference rules) for functional (and strong functional) dependencies in one-level, NL-class relations.",

    "abstract": "In this paper, we propose an efficient power control algorithm for the downlink wireless CDMA systems. The goal of our paper is to achieve the optimum and fair resource utilization by maximizing a weighted sum utility with the power constraint. In fact, the objective function in the power optimization problem is always nonconcave, which makes the problem difficult to solve. We make progress in solving this type of optimization problem using PSO (particle swarm optimization). PSO is a new evolution algorithm based on the movement and intelligence of swarms looking for the most fertile feeding location, which can solve discontinuous, nonconvex and nonlinear problems efficiently. It's proved that the proposed algorithm converges to the global optimal solutions in this paper. Numerical examples show that our algorithm can guarantee the fast convergence and fairness within a few iterations. It also demonstrates that our algorithm can efficiently solve the nonconvex optimization problems when we study the different utility functions in more realistic settings.",

    "abstract": "News-casters are Twitter users who periodically pick up interesting news from online news media and spread it to their followers' network. Existing works on Twitter user analysis have only analysed a  pre-defined set of users  for user modeling, influence analysis and news recommendation. The problem of identifying  prominent ,  trustworthy  and  consistent  news-casters is unaddressed so far. In this paper, we present a framework,  NCFinder , to discover top- k  consistent news-casters  directly  from Twitter. NCFinder uses news headlines published in online news sources to periodically collect authentic news-tweets and processes them to discover news-casters, news sources and news concepts. Next, NCFinder builds a tripartite graph among news-casters, news source and news concepts and employs HITS algorithm on it to score the news-casters on daily basis. The daily score profiles of the news-casters collected over a time-period are then used to infer top-$k$ consistent news-casters. We run NCFinder from 11th Nov. to 24th Nov., 2014 and discover top-100 consistent news-casters and their profile information.",

The purpose was to evaluate users' sensitivity to surface texture, target position at designated probe points on a cylinder real object surface, virtual pointer form and binocular disparity. The results confirmed the main findings from a previous study: that both surface texture and target position have significant influences. Subjective evaluation of virtual pointer form revealed that a three dimensional pointer is preferred over one and two-dimensional pointers. The contributions of size cue and resolution to binocular disparity effects are also discussed in relation to interface design issues for augmented reality applications.",

These systems have attained an increasing interest as they have proved to be competent in wide spectrum of applications - i.e. imaging of subsurface inclusions in composite structures. The lateral resolution of these probes, and hence the quality of the captured images, is inversely proportional to the electrical area of the waveguide aperture. In order to obtain images of high fidelity for small sized concealed entities, the resolution of the rectangular waveguide probes should be enhanced. In this paper, it will be shown that smoothly tapering the waveguide's aperture in the E-plane significantly improves the spatial resolution of the imaging system. The potential of the proposed probe on the quality of captured images will be demonstrated in real-life NDE problem. Furthermore, the resolution of the new probe will be compared to that of the conventional one.",

    "abstract": "Temporal isolation in real-time systems allows the execution of software processes isolated from one another in the temporal domain. Intuitively, the execution of a process is temporally isolated if the real-time behavior of the process is independent of the execution of the other concurrently scheduled processes in the system. The article provides a comprehensive discussion of temporal isolation through variable-bandwidth servers (VBSs). VBS consists of an EDF-based uniprocessor scheduling algorithm and a utilization-based schedulability test. The scheduling algorithm runs in constant time modulo the time complexity of queue management. The schedulability test runs in time linear in the number of processes and enables admission of an individual process in constant time. The test is a sufficient condition for VBS to provide temporal isolation through lower and upper response-time bounds on processes. We present the VBS design, implementation, proofs, and experiments, followed by condensed versions of results on scheduler overhead accounting with VBS and on reducing power consumption in VBS systems.",

    "abstract": "Enrollment in computer science classes have grown at an alarming rate despite often inadequate university resources and a shortage of trained computer science faculty. While the number of computer science faculty. While the number of computer science majors may now be leveling off or even declining, many other disciplines are requiring students to possess computer skills. An all too high percentage of students do not possess a sufficient academic background which thereby causes a high attrition rate in computing courses. These failures represent a loss of both university and student resources.  Whether choosing a selected group of students from a large number trying to enroll in a specific course or program or attempting to offer different prerequisite computer classes based on student need and aptitude, some method for predicting performance is required. This study was conducted to see what variables might be predictors of success in a first computer science course.  In this study, success in the beginning course for computer science majors and minors was defined as earning a grade of C or better, while failure was considered as receiving a D, an F, or withdrawing from the course. The authors believe, from their experience, that what one instructor would evaluate as A caliber work another instructor might rate only as B performance. However, instructor agreement improves when performance is rated as acceptable (C or above) or not acceptable (D, F or withdrawal). The predictors used included success in a beginning calculus course, SAT quantitative and verbal scores, high school class percentile rank, sex of the student, quarter in which the course was taken, class status of the student, and the instructor who taught the course. The sample was 262 students enrolled in different sections of the beginning course during three different quarters 1984-85.  The stepwise logistic regression model was chosen because the dependent variable was dichotomized as described above and the predictor variables were either interval or categorical. High school class percentile rank was computed by subtracting the rank of the student in his or her graduating class from the size of the graduating class, dividing this difference by the size of graduating class. This variable, then, is interval, SAT verbal and SAT quantitative scores are interval variables. Success in the beginning calculus course was defined the same way as success in the beginning computer science course was defined, with a third category added for students who had not attempted calculus. Thus, success in the beginning calculus course, sex of the student, the quarter in which the course was taken, and the instructor are categorical variables. SAT scores, the mathematics prerequisite, and sex of the student have been tested by others as predictors for success in computer science. [1, 2, 3, 4, 5].  The other studies noted above assume that course grades are on an equal interval scale which allowed the use of an ordinary regression model. The predictor variables in an ordinary regression model must either be continuous or have only two categories. The model used in the present study allows the stepwise technique utilized in the studies cited above for ordering predictor variables into the equation, but also allows categorical predictors to have more than two states if they are not independent.  The results of this study indicate that the best predictor of success in the computer science course is success in a calculus course. This result supports the findings in other studies [2, 5]. The second best predictor found was high school class percentile rank. The only other variables that could account for variation in the dependent variable were sex of the student and class status of the student. A prior study also suggests that male students performed better in computer science courses. [2]  The authors have concluded from the results that the reasoning skills necessary for success in calculus are also important for success in computer science. Another trait for success is the competitiveness of the student. This trait is measured in some degree by the high school percentile rank.",

The main features of this modeling environment are: version control of models and data; client-server architecture, which allows the interaction among modelers and decision makers; the use of a database to store information about the models and data scenarios; and the use of remote servers of optimization, which allows the optimization problems to be solved on different machines. The modeling environment proposed in this work was validated using mathematical programming models that exploit different characteristics, such as the treatment of conditions for generating variables and constraints, the use of calculated parameters derived from other parameters, and the use of integer and continuous variables in mixed IP models among others. This validation showed that the proposed environment is able to treat models found in various application areas of operations research and to solve problems with tens of thousands of variables and constraints.",

In South Africa, the challenge in higher education is to redress past inequalities and to restructure the educational system to rise to the challenges of a modern country that can be competitive in the 21st Century. Technological developments must therefore be used as multipliers to solve the escalating pressures by increased access, equity, redress and quality in education. While technology can fulfil a significant role, we propose that, give current levels of infrastructure development, the introduction of technology will increase the gap between developed and underdeveloped communities and should therefore rather be utilized to free up available educational resources.",

The correctness of the Maude specification is verified using LTL model checking and the test sequences from each classified environment are generated using reach ability computation provided by the Maude rewriting engine. Experimental evaluation shows that constraint-based test generation using Maude can be as effective as that of using NuS MV, a state machine based specification language specialized for model checking and specification-based testing, but more expressive and flexible.",

    "abstract": "This paper presents a novel multimedia information system, called SAPTE, for supporting the discourse analysis and information retrieval of television programs from their corresponding video recordings. Unlike most common systems, SAPTE uses both content independent and dependent metadata, which are determined by the application of discourse analysis techniques as well as image and audio analysis methods. The proposed system was developed in partnership with the free-to-air Brazilian TV channel Rede Minas in an attempt to provide TV researchers with computational tools to assist their studies about this media universe. The system is based on the Matterhorn framework for managing video libraries, combining: (1) discourse analysis techniques for describing and indexing the videos, by considering aspects, such as, definitions of the subject of analysis, the nature of the speaker and the corpus of data resulting from the discourse; (2) a state of the art decoder software for large vocabulary continuous speech recognition, called Julius; (3) image and frequency domain techniques to compute visual signatures for the video recordings, containing color, shape and texture information; and (4) hashing and k-d tree methods for data indexing. The capabilities of SAPTE were successfully validated, as demonstrated by our experimental results, indicating that SAPTE is a promising computational tool for TV researchers.",

    "abstract": "We give a simple and efficient algorithm for approximating computation of disparities in a pair of rectified frames of an image sequence. The algorithm consists of rendering a sparse set of correspondences, which are triangulated, expanded and corrected in the areas of occlusions and homogeneous texture by a color distribution algorithm. The obtained approximations of the disparity maps are refined by a semi-global algorithm. The algorithm was tested for three data sets with rather different data quality. The results of the performance of our method are presented and areas of applications and future research are outlined.",

    "abstract": "Male college students use the Internet more than female students.Daily Internet usage time has a large impact on its negative consequences.Smoking, alcohol use, and gambling are risk factors for problematic Internet use.Problematic Internet use increases as students' life satisfaction decreases.Problematic Internet use is higher in students with poor family relationships. One goal of this research was to analyze problematic Internet use in university students according to such variables as gender, grade point average, satisfaction with one's department, mother's/father's education level, smoking, alcohol consumption, gambling behavior, relationship between parents, length of Internet use, amount of time spent on the Internet daily, and using the Internet for academic purposes. Another goal was to analyze family functioning and life satisfaction as predictors of problematic Internet use in university students. The study sample comprised 663 university students from Dokuz Eylul University, Izmir. The Problematic Internet Use Scale, Family Evaluation Scale, Life Satisfaction Scale, and a questionnaire requesting demographic information were administered. The results revealed that the family functioning dimensions of problem solving, roles, and behavioral control, as well as gender, age, gambling behavior, perception of the relationship between one's parents, number of years of Internet use, amount of time spent on the Internet daily, and using the Internet for academic purposes explained 48% of the total variance in Internet use. There was also a significant relationship between university students' life satisfaction and total Internet use, rate of Internet overuse, and the social benefits and negative consequences of Internet use.",

A rigorous analysis of the theoretical properties of the solutions obtained by these algorithms, for full constraint satisfaction and partial constraint satisfaction, respectively, is given. The proposed methods allow to enlarge the applicability of the existing randomized methods to real-world applications involving a large number of design variables. Since the proposed approach does not provide  a priori  bounds on the sample complexity, extensive numerical simulations, dealing with an application to hard-disk drive servo design, are provided. These simulations testify the goodness of the proposed solution.",

We built an automated spoken questionnaire for the US Bureau of the Census. In the project's first phase, the basic recognizers and dialogue system were developed using 4000 calls. In the second phase, the system was adapted to meet Census Bureau requirements and deployed in the Bureau's 1995 national test of new technologies. In the third phase, we refined the system and showed empirically that an automated spoken questionnaire could successfully collect and recognize census data, and that subjects preferred the spoken system to written questionnaires. Our large data collection effort and two subsequent field tests showed that, when questions are asked correctly, the answers contain information within the desired response categories about 99% of the time.",

In particular, we present techniques that assist in the task to simplify huge expressions of such multi-sums in a completely automatic fashion. The ideas are illustrated on new calculations coming from 3-loop topologies of gluonic massive operator matrix elements containing two fermion lines, which contribute to the transition matrix elements in the variable flavor scheme.",

    "abstract": "Video transmission over error-prone networks can suffer from packet erasures which can greatly reduce the quality of the received video. Error concealment methods reduce the perceived quality degradation at the receiving end by masking the effects of such errors. They accomplish this by exploiting temporal and spatial correlations that exist in image sequences. Spatial error concealment approaches conceal errors by making use of spatial information only which is necessary in cases where motion information is not available or reliable. The performance of such methods can be greatly increased if perceptual considerations are taken into account as, e.g., the preservation of edge information. This paper proposes a spatial error concealment method that uses edge-related information in order not only to preserve existing edges but also to avoid introducing new strong ones by switching to a smooth approximation of missing information where necessary. A novel switching algorithm which uses the directional entropy of neighbouring edges chooses between two interpolation methods, a directional along detected edges or a bilinear using the nearest neighbouring pixels. Results show that the performance of the proposed method is better compared to both \u2018single interpolation\u2019 and to edge strength-based switching methods.",

    "abstract": "In this paper, we present an in-car Chinese noise corpus that can be used in simulating complicated car environment for robust speech recognition research and experiment. The corpus was collected in mainland China in 2009 and 2010. The corpus includes a diversity of car conditions including different car speed, open/close windows, weather conditions as well as environment conditions. Specially, the rumble strips are also taken into account due to the typical noise generated as the car is passing on. In order to use the corpus efficiently, we performed some acoustic signal analyses on those noise data, mainly focused on stationary properties and energy distribution in the frequency domain. We also performed ASR experiments using selected noise data from the corpus, by adding noise data to clean speech to simulate the in-car environment. The corpus is the first of its kind for in-car Chinese noise corpus, providing abundant and diversified samples for car noise speech recognition task.",

Specifically an automatic test generation approach is proposed for this particular testing method. The proposed approach makes full use of a boolean satisfiability solver (SAT solver). Due to recent rapid advance, modern SAT solvers are able to handle very large problem instances. Using a SAT solver thus allows us both to efficiently find hidden constraints on possible tests and to search for a good test set.",

    "abstract": "Network simulation is an important tool for testing and evaluating wireless sensor network applications. Parallel simulation strategies improve the scalability of these tools. However, achieving high performance depends on reducing the synchronization overhead among simulation processes. In this paper we present an optimistic simulation algorithm with support for backtracking and re-execution. The algorithm reduces the number of synchronization cycles to the number of transmissions in the network under test. We implement SnapSim, an extension to the popular Avrora simulator, based on this algorithm. The experimental results show that our prototype system improves the performance of Avrora by 2 to 10 times for typical network-centric sensor network applications, and up to three orders of magnitude for applications that use the radio infrequently.",

The idea behind MoSeab is a direct probing technique based on a statistical model for network data transmissions. Differing from the other direct probing techniques, MoSeab does not require any a priori knowledge of network path. It has proven valid even when there are multiple bottlenecks. Simulation and real Internet experiments demonstrate the accuracy and robustness of MoSeab, and show its advantages over Spruce, PathChirp, and IGI. Moreover, its probing traffic control mechanism makes MoSeab a non-intrusive solution suitable to be integrated into various network applications.",

This paper proposes a novel vector quantization method using the wavelet transform and the enhanced SOM algorithm for the medical image compression. We propose the enhanced self-organizing algorithm to resolve the defects of the conventional SOM algorithm. The enhanced SOM, at first, reflects the error between the winner node and the input vector to the weight adaptation by using the frequency of the selection of the winner node. Secondly, it adjusts the weight in proportion to the present weight change and the previous one as well. To reduce the blocking effect and the computation requirement, we construct training image vectors involving image features by using the wavelet transform and apply the enhanced SOM algorithm to them for generating a well-defined codebook. Our experimental results have shown that the proposed method energizes the compression ratio and the decompression quality.",

    "abstract": "The development of an information system in Caribbean public sector organisations is usually seen as a matter of installing hardware and software according to a directive from senior management, without much planning. This causes huge investment in procuring hardware and software without improving overall system performance. Increasingly, Caribbean organisations are looking for assurances on information system performance before making investment decisions not only to satisfy the funding agencies, but also to be competitive in this dynamic and global business world. This study demonstrates an information system planning approach using a process-reengineering framework. Firstly, the stakeholders for the business functions are identified along with their relationships and requirements. Secondly, process reengineering is carried out to develop the system requirements. Accordingly, information technology is selected through detailed system requirement analysis. Thirdly, cost-benefit analysis, identification of critical success factors and risk analysis are carried out to strengthen the selection. The entire methodology has been demonstrated through an information system project in the Barbados drug service, a public sector organisation in the Caribbean.",

    "abstract": "Multi agent systems with autonomous interaction, negotiation and learning capabilities can efficiently model social behavior of individuals participating in a social network. A central problem in a social network is to identify the nodes that actively participate in the expansion of the net both physically and functionally. Several metrics have already been proposed to identify those hot spots. The algorithms to identify hot spots are either heuristic based or computationally expensive. In this paper we use an agent model of the social net and propose a method that can identify the neutral nodes, i.e. the nodes that can never be considered as hot spot nodes given the network topology and rules of negotiation among nodes. Therefore these nodes can be eliminated from the net. A direct advantage of this method is reducing the computational complexity for the configuration and identification of hot spots. Through a case study we have shown that the proposed method can lead to 33% reduction of computation regarding the number of agent types in the example.",

    "abstract": "The significance of the earliest phase of decision making stems from the fact that decision makers \u201cframe\u201d problems during this phase. These frames shape all subsequent decision making phases, fundamentally conditioning decision making outcomes. Avenues not considered at this stage are unlikely to be considered in the future. Further, decision making is most creative at these stages: there is a great deal of uncertainty at play but there are fewer constraints and there is less at stake. This paper argues that virtual worlds offer a potent combination of social, sensory and simulational capabilities that can stimulate creativity in decision making; and it also reports the findings of an investigation of the behavioural and cognitive aspects of creative decision making in Second Life\u00ae. The findings illustrate that Second Life users are faced with a kind of \u201ctyranny of freedom\u201d: if anything is possible, where does one start?

    "abstract": "The optimization of logistics in large building complexes with many resources, such as hospitals, require realistic facility management and planning. Current planning practices rely foremost on manual observations or coarse unverified assumptions and therefore do not properly scale or provide realistic data to inform facility planning. In this paper, we propose analysis methods to extract knowledge from large sets of network collected WiFi traces to better inform facility management and planning in large building complexes. The analysis methods, which build on a rich set of temporal and spatial features, include methods for noise removal, e.g., labeling of beyond building-perimeter devices, and methods for quantification of area densities and flows, e.g., building enter and exit events, and for classifying the behavior of people, e.g., into user roles such as visitor, hospitalized or employee. Spatio-temporal visualization tools built on top of these methods enable planners to inspect and explore extracted information to inform facility-planning activities. To evaluate the methods, we present results for a large hospital complex covering more than 10 hectares. The evaluation is based on WiFi traces collected in the hospital's WiFi infrastructure over two weeks observing around 18000 different devices recording more than a billion individual WiFi measurements. For the presented analysis methods we present quantitative performance results, e.g., demonstrating over 95% accuracy for correct noise removal of beyond building perimeter devices. We furthermore present detailed statistics from our analysis regarding people's presence, movement and roles, and example types of visualizations that both highlight their potential as inspection tools for planners and provide interesting insights into the test-bed hospital.",

It is shown that the performance of the proposed detector, which is called the SIC-based detector with list and LR, can approach that of the maximum-likelihood (ML) detector with a short list length. For example, the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) loss of the proposed detector, compared with that of the ML detector, is less than 1 dB for a 4 times 4 MIMO system with 16-state quadrature amplitude modulation (QAM) at a bit error rate (BER) of 10 -3  with a list length of 8.",

Such videos require new methods to apply text detection. In this paper, we are introducing a novel text detection technique using many blocks coming from frame decomposition. Each block is analyzed and classified which allowed the extraction of text coordinates using MapReduce programming model. To validate our approach, we test it on YouTube Video Text (YVT) dataset and we found that the running speed of this approach can be more than 2 times as fast as classic approach.",

We present extensions to the Chord and Gnutella protocol to incorporate our consistency techniques and implement our extensions to Gnutella into a Gtk-Gnutella prototype. An experimental evaluation of our techniques shows that: (i) a push-based approach achieves near-perfect fidelity in a stable overlay network, (ii) a hybrid approach based on push and pull achieves high fidelity in highly dynamic overlay networks and (iii) the run-time overheads of our techniques are small, making them a practical choice for overlay networks.",

    "abstract": "Working in various service models ranging from SaaS, PaaS, to IaaS, cloud computing is viewed by many as anew revolution in IT, and could reshape the paradigm of how IT industry works today. Storage services are a fundamental function offered by cloud computing. A typical use scenario of the cloud storage services is that an enterprise outsources its database to the cloud and authorizes multiple users to access the database. In such cases of database outsourcing, data encryption is a good approach enabling the data owner to retain its control over the outsourced data. {\\em Searchable encryption} is a cryptographic primitive allowing for private keyword based search over the encrypted database. The above setting of enterprise outsourcing database to the cloud requires multi-user searchable encryption, whereas virtually all existing schemes consider the single-user setting. To bridge this gap, we are motivated to propose a practical multi-user searchable encryption scheme, which has a number of advantages over the known approaches. The associated model and security requirements are also formulated.",

    "abstract": "Estimating the effect of price changes on demand is an essential task for retailers. This study proposes a methodology based on consumer utility for modeling the price thresholds phenomenon that allows for threshold asymmetry, incorporates consumer heterogeneity and uses weekly aggregated brand-level data. Unlike other studies based on consumer utility models, which generate results only for the price elasticity of market share, a methodology for estimating price elasticity of demand is also included. Data on fast-moving goods (detergents, toilet paper, soft drinks, meats, liquid juices and yogurts) supplied by a major retail chain are used to demonstrate the existence of price thresholds and their effects on price elasticity. In every case it was found that within the thresholds or latitude of acceptance, consumers are relatively less sensitive to price variations while beyond them a higher sensitivity was observed. In some cases a product brand was classified as inelastic within the latitude of acceptance and elastic outside of it.",

    "abstract": "In this paper we present an efficient two-step approach of using a shape characterization function called centroid-contour distance curve and the object eccentricity (or elongation) for leaf image retrieval. Both the centroid-contour distance curve and the eccentricity of a leaf image are scale, rotation, and translation invariant after proper normalizations. In the frist step, the eccentricity is used to rank leaf images, and the top scored images are further ranked using the centroid-contour distance curve together with the eccentricity in the second step. A thinning-based method is used to locate start point(s) for reducing the matching time. Experimental results show that our approach can achieve good performance with a reasonable computational complexity.",

    "abstract": "We propose an effective and low cost method to increase the yield and the lifetime of torus NoCs. The method consists in detecting and diagnosing NoC interconnect faults using BIST structures and activating alternative paths for the faulty links. Alternative paths use the inherent redundancy of the torus topology, thus leading to minimal performance, area, and power overhead. We assume an extended interconnect fault model comprising stuck-at and pairwise shorts within a single link or between any two links in the network. Experimental results for a 3x3 NoC show that the proposed approach can correctly diagnose 93% of all possible interconnect faults and can mitigate 42% of those faults (representing 94.4% of the solvable faults) with a worst case performance penalty of 8% and 1% of area overhead. We also demonstrate the scalability of the method by presenting its application to larger NoCs.",

In practice, this process is not yet obvious to follow. Many methods are proposed to support one or several steps of the process. But, which method to use and how to apply it still remains problematic. The MAP is a process meta-model proposed to support methods specification and their enactment. We have already used the MAP to express the CBD process, and the MAP was also used to express PORE, a COTS selection method. In this paper, we propose to generalize the use of the MAP to express both the CBD process and COTS related methods, especially selection ones. As a result, the developer is guided in the process of choosing the appropriate method and its application.",

    "abstract": "Linear algebra operations arise in a myriad of scientific and engineering applications and, therefore, their optimization is targeted by a significant number of high performance computing research efforts. In particular, the matrix multiplication and the solution of linear systems are two key problems with efficient implementations (or kernels) for a variety of high performance parallel architectures. For these specific problems, leveraging the structure of the associated matrices often leads to remarkable time and memory savings, as is the case, e.g., for symmetric band problems. In this work, we exploit the ample hardware concurrency of many-core graphics processors (GPUs) to accelerate the solution of symmetric positive definite band linear systems, introducing highly tuned versions of the corresponding LAPACK routines. The experimental results with the new GPU kernels reveal important reductions of the execution time when compared with tuned implementations of the same operations provided in Intel's MKL. In addition, we evaluate the performance of the GPU kernels when applied to the solution of model order reduction problems and the associated matrix equations.",

In this brief, we present the infinite HCRF (iHCRF), which is a nonparametric model based on hierarchical Dirichlet processes and is capable of automatically learning the optimal number of hidden states for a classification task. We show how we learn the model hyperparameters with an effective Markov-chain Monte Carlo sampling technique, and we explain the process that underlines our iHCRF model with the Restaurant Franchise Rating Agencies analogy. We show that the iHCRF is able to converge to a correct number of represented hidden states, and outperforms the best finite HCRFs-chosen via cross-validation-for the difficult tasks of recognizing instances of agreement, disagreement, and pain. Moreover, the iHCRF manages to achieve this performance in significantly less total training, validation, and testing time.",

    "abstract": "In wireless multihop ad hoc networks, nodes need to contend for the shared wireless channel with their neighbors, which could result in congestions and greatly decrease the end-to-end throughput due to severe packet loss. Several recent papers have indicated that the IEEE 802.11 fails to achieve the optimum schedule for this kind of contentions. In this paper, we present a framework of multihop packet scheduling to achieve maximum throughput for traffic flows in the shared channel environment. The key idea is based on the observation that in the IEEE 802.11 MAC protocol the maximum throughput for chain topology is 1/4 of the channel bandwidth and its optimum packet scheduling is to allow simultaneous transmissions at nodes which are four hops away. The proposed fully distributed scheme generalizes this optimum scheduling to any traffic flows which may encounter intra-flow contentions and inter-flow contentions. Extensive simulations indicate that our scheme could perform well and achieve high throughput at light to heavy traffic load while the performance of the original IEEE 802.11 MAC protocol greatly degrades when the traffic load becomes heavy. Moreover, our scheme also achieves much better and more stable performance in terms of delay, fairness and scalability with low and stable control overhead.",

    "abstract": "A method has been investigated for the synthesis of memoryless logical networks using a restricted repertoire of functional modules. The method is based on the reduced general solution to a generalized system of Boolean equations (BE) as applied to the decomposition of Boolean functions. The aim of the synthesis is to obtain the most constrained circuit having at most two levels of gating. The constraints take the form of single input variables or constant logic levels applied to the inputs of the first level gate. This is achieved by assembling a set of constraint equations which are then a part of the generalized system of BE. The method is then tested on some synthesis examples of single and multiple output functions in terms of the NAND and (WOS) modules.",

    "abstract": "The temporal component of social networks is often neglected in their analysis, and statistical measures are typically performed on a \"static\" representation of the network. As a result, measures of importance (like betweenness centrality) cannot reveal any temporal role of the entities involved. Our goal is to start filling this limitation by proposing a form of temporal betweenness measure, and by using it to analyse a knowledge mobilization network. We show that this measure, which takes time explicitly into account, allows us to detect centrality roles that were completely hidden in the classical statistical analysis. In particular, we uncover nodes whose static centrality was considered negligible, but whose temporal role is instead important to accelerate mobilization flow in the network. We also observe the reverse behaviour by detecting nodes with high static centrality, whose role as temporal bridges is instead very low. By revealing important temporal roles, this study is a first step towards a better understanding of the impact of time in social networks, and opens the road to further investigation.",

Over the past four years MINT has undergone extensive revision. The new version of MINT is based on a completely remodeled database structure, which offers more efficient data exploration and analysis, and is characterized by entries with a richer annotation. Over the past few years the number of curated physical interactions has soared to over 95 000. The whole dataset can be freely accessed online in both interactive and batch modes through web-based interfaces and an FTP server.

In the literature, the issue of predicting stock price up/down trend based on news articles has been studied. In this paper, we study a new problem which is to predict the risk of stocks by their corresponding news of companies. We discuss the unique challenges of volatility prediction, volatility ranking and volatility index construction. A new feature selection approach is proposed to select bursty volatility features. Such selected features can accurately represent/simulate volatility bursts. A volatility prediction method is then proposed based on random walk by considering both the direct impacts of bursty volatility features on the stocks and the propagated impacts through correlation between stocks. Finally, we construct a volatility index, called VN-index, which is a time series of predicted stock volatility. Moreover, stocks are ranked based on the predicted volatility values. Such information provides investors with knowledge on how widely a stock price is dispersed from the average, as an important indicator of stock risks in a stock market. We conducted extensive experimental studies using real datasets and report our findings in this paper.",

While simpler and more efficient than other random acquisition techniques like Compressed Sensing, random filtering is sufficiently generic to summarize many types of compressible signals and generalizes to streaming and continuous-time signals.

    "abstract": "The particle swarm optimization method (PSO) is one of population-based optimization techniques for global optimization, where a number of candidate solutions called particles simultaneously move toward the tentative solutions found by particles so far, which are called the personal and global bests, respectively. Since, in the PSO, the exploration ability is important to find a desirable solution, various kinds of methods have been investigated to improve it. In this paper, we propose a PSO with a new chaotic system derived from the steepest descent method for a virtual quartic objective function with perturbations having its global minima at the personal and global bests, where elements of each particle's position are updated by the proposed chaotic system or the standard update formula. Thus, the proposed PSO can search for solutions around the personal and global bests intensively without being trapped at any local minimum due to the chaoticness. Moreover, we show approximately the sufficient condition of parameter values of the proposed system under which the system is chaotic. Through computational experiments, we verify the performance of the proposed PSO by applying it to some global optimization problems.",

    "abstract": "We consider a controllability technique for the numerical solution of the Helmholtz equation. The original time-harmonic equation is represented as an exact controllability problem for the time-dependent wave equation. This problem is then formulated as a least-squares optimization problem, which is solved by the conjugate gradient method. Such an approach was first suggested and developed in the 1990s by French researchers and we introduce some improvements to its practical realization. We use higher-order spectral elements for spatial discretization, which leads to high accuracy and lumped mass matrices. Higher-order approximation reduces the pollution effect associated with finite element approximation of time-harmonic wave equations, and mass lumping makes explicit time-stepping schemes for the wave equation very efficient. We also derive a new way to compute the gradient of the least-squares functional and use algebraic multigrid method for preconditioning the conjugate gradient algorithm. Numerical results demonstrate the significant improvements in efficiency due to the higher-order spectral elements. For a given accuracy, spectral element method requires fewer computational operations than conventional finite element method. In addition, by using higher-order polynomial basis the influence of the pollution effect is reduced.",

    "abstract": "Advanced type systems for the \u03c0-calculus have recently been proposed to guarantee deadlock-freedom in the sense that certain communications will eventually succeed unless the whole process diverges. Although such guarantees are useful for reasoning about the behavior of concurrent programs, there still remains the weakness that the success of a communication is not completely guaranteed due to the possibility of divergence. For example, although a server process that has received a request message cannot discard the request, it is allowed to infinitely delegate the request to other processes, causing a livelock. In this paper, we present a type system which guarantees that certain communications will eventually succeed under fair scheduling, regardless of whether processes diverge. We also present a variant of the type system which guarantees that a communication will succeed within a given number of reduction steps.",

    "abstract": "Data-driven macroprogramming of wireless sensor networks (WSNs) provides an easy to use high-level task graph representation to the application developer. However, determining an energy-efficient initial placement of these tasks onto the nodes of the target network poses a set of interesting problems. We present a framework to model this task-mapping problem arising in WSN macroprogramming. Our model can capture placement constraints in tasks, as well as multiple possible routes in the target network. Using our framework, we provide mathematical formulations for the task-mapping problem for two different metrics-energy balance and total energy spent. For both metrics, we address scenarios where (1) a single or (2) multiple paths are possible between nodes. Due to the complex nature of the problems, these formulations are not linear. We provide linearization heuristics for the same, resulting in mixed-integer programming (MIP) formulations. We also provide efficient heuristics for the above. Our experiments show that our heuristics give the same results as the MIP for real-world sensor network macroprograms, and show a speedup of up to several orders of magnitude. We also provide worst-case performance bounds of the heuristics.",

    "abstract": "The paper addresses the following problem: given a set of man-made shapes, e.g., chairs, can we quickly rank and explore the set of shapes with respect to a given avatar pose? Answering this question requires identifying which shapes are more suitable for the defined avatar and pose; and moreover, to provide fast preview of how to alter the input geometry to better fit the deformed shapes to the given avatar pose? The problem naturally links physical proportions of human body and its interaction with object shapes in an attempt to connect ergonomics with shape geometry. We designed an interaction system that allows users to explore shape collections using the deformation of human characters while at the same time providing interactive previews of how to alter the shapes to better fit the user-specified character. We achieve this by first mapping ergonomics guidelines into a set of simultaneous multi-part constraints based on target contacts; and then, proposing a novel contact-based deformation model to realize multi-contact constraints. We evaluate our framework on various chair models and validate the results via a small user study.",

In general, however, this condition is unnecessary. Then the fitting can be further improved. Considering a representative quadrant of E, we first draw two auxiliary circular arcs tangent to E at the axes but having a gap @e at their boundary, such that the small arc S lies outside the large arc L. Meanwhile the extreme errors of S and L w.r.t. E are @e and -@e respectively. Giving the radii of S and L a decrement -@e/2 and an increment @e/2 brings them to join smoothly.

    "abstract": "The 3D evaluation of design shapes is an essential step in product styling. Thus, physical models of final-stage design alternatives have been made in tradition, and recently the effort to substitute them with CAD models has been tried. Whereas, designers in the early phase of the design-development stage where almost design concepts are determined, still use raster-type 2D graphics S/Ws. It causes not only the difficulty of evaluating 3D shapes but also the serious severance of a digital dis-connectivity with downstream processes. This paper presents a method of directly constructing 3D plane-symmetric freeform curves with a sketch interface, as the first step of developing a sketch-based 3D-freeform shape creation S/W for designers. A curve drawn by the designer within the see-through box in an arbitrary perspective view, is simultaneously converted to a real space curve without the 3D ambiguity problem except only special cases to be specified.",

    "abstract": "The present work discusses and compares the toluene sensing behavior of polyaniline (PANI) and graphene/polyaniline nanocomposite (C-PANI) films. The graphene\u2013PANI ratio in the nanocomposite polymer film is optimized at 1:2. For this, N-methyl-2-pyrrolidone (NMP) solvent is used to prepare PANI-NMP solution as well as graphene-PANI-NMP solution. The films are later annealed at 230 \u00b0C, characterized using scanning electron microscopy (SEM) as well Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR) and tested for their sensing behavior towards toluene. The sensing behaviors of the films are analyzed at different temperatures (30, 50 and 100 \u00b0C) for 100 ppm toluene in air. The nanocomposite C-PANI films have exhibited better overall toluene sensing behavior in terms of sensor response, response and recovery time as well as repeatability. Although the sensor response of PANI (12.6 at 30 \u00b0C, 38.4 at 100 \u00b0C) is comparatively higher than that of C-PANI (8.4 at 30 \u00b0C, 35.5 at 100 \u00b0C), response and recovery time of PANI and C-PANI varies with operating temperature. C-PANI at 50 \u00b0C seems to have better toluene sensing behavior in terms of response time and recovery time.",

The present article uses a case study of a flexible development practice which so far has proved to be sustainable and successful to reconsider user involvement and software development practices of small software providers from an agile perspective.

    "abstract": "The Atomic Force Microscope using contact mode forms the image by contacting the sample surface with a sharp tip that is attached to the free end of a cantilever. While the sample is scanned horizontally the cantilever deflects. The deflection of the cantilever can be sensed among several methods. For instance, optical beam deflection where this method is often used because of it's simplicity. While the scanning process of the sample stage, the detected deflection is compared with the set point deflection. Then, the error signal which is the difference between the detected and set point deflection is minimized by moving the sample stage in the Z - direction. At a set point value this closed -loop feedback operation can maintain the cantilever deflection and hence the tip - sample interaction force. The sample surface is approximately traced by the resulting 3D movement of the sample stage. Therefore, usually the topographic image can be formed from the electrical signals which are used to drive the sample stage scanner in the Z- direction. In this paper, the AFM topographic image is constructed using values obtained by summing the height image that is used for driving the Z- scanner and the deflection image with a weight function that is \u221d close to 3. The value of \u221d has been determined experimentally using trail and error. This method gives more faithful topographic image.",

    "abstract": "CDMA/HDR system is designed to provide High Data Rate services in the cellular networks compatible with IS-95B CDMA network. It uses a PF (Proportional Fairness) scheduler that improves total throughput by using multi-user diversity in a forward link while supporting user's average throughput proportional to channel conditions. Therefore, PFS does not guarantee the minimum data rate to the users with poor channel conditions. We propose a new scheduling algorithm, which bounds the throughput ratio (Rmax/Rmin) between the best-channel user and the worst-channel user and maximizes the total throughput. Thus, it can guarantees minimum bandwidth by adapting the throughput ratio (Rmax/Rmin). Furthermore, if the user data in the queue is less than the accommodation size of the assigned slot, there will be a loss of efficiency. We add a function to the scheduler to protect the system from this performance degradation.",

Variable topology structure transformation of Leg-Flipper by actuation redundancy enables the robot to achieve a variety of locomotion. Our motivation is to provide another solution to achieve amphibious movement both easily and efficiently. A prototype of MiniTurtle-I is built to exam the configuration transformations.

    "abstract": "The biological hypothesis of spinal engine states that locomotion is mainly achieved by the spine, while the legs may serve as assistance. Inspired by this hypothesis, a compliant, multiple degree-of-freedom, biologically-inspired spine has been embedded into a quadruped robot, named Kitty, which has no actuation on the legs. In this paper, we demonstrate how versatile behaviors (bounding, trotting, and turning) can be generated exclusively by the spine's movements through dynamical interaction between the controller, the body, and the environment, known as embodiment. Moreover, we introduce information theoretic approach to quantitatively study the spine internal dynamics and its effect on the bounding gait based on three spinal morphologies. These three morphologies differ in the position of virtual spinal joint where the spine is easier to get bent. The experimental results reveal that locomotion can be enhanced by using the spine featuring a rear virtual spinal joint, which offers more freedom for the rear legs to move forward. In addition, the information theoretic analysis shows that, according to the morphological differences of the spine, the information structure changes. The relationship between the observed behavior of the robot and the corresponding information structure is discussed in detail.",

The framework is based on an autonomous steering program interfacing in real time with a racing simulator: hence the teacher is a racing program having perfect insight into its position on the road, whereas the student learns to steer from visual gist only. Experiments show that (i) such a framework allows the visual driver to drive around the track successfully after a few iterations, demonstrating that visual gist is sufficient input to drive the car successfully; and (ii) the number of training rounds required to drive around a track reduces when the student has experienced other tracks, showing that the learnt model generalises well to unseen tracks.",

    "abstract": "We present a study evaluating two respiratory rate estimation algorithms using videos obtained from placing a finger on the camera lens of a mobile phone. The two algorithms, based on Smart Fusion and empirical mode decomposition (EMD), consist of previously developed signal processing methods to detect features and extract respiratory induced variations in photoplethysmographic signals to estimate respiratory rate. With custom-built software on an Android phone, photoplethysmographic imaging videos were recorded from 19 healthy adults while breathing spontaneously at respiratory rates between 6 to 32 breaths/min. Signals from two pulse oximeters were simultaneously recorded to compare the algorithms\u2019 performance using mobile phone data and clinical data. Capnometry was recorded to obtain reference respiratory rates. Two hundred seventy-two recordings were analyzed. The Smart Fusion algorithm reported 39 recordings with insufficient respiratory information from the photoplethysmographic imaging data. Of the 232 remaining recordings, a root mean square error (RMSE) of 6 breaths/min was obtained. The RMSE for the pulse oximeter data was lower at 2.3 breaths/min. RMSE for the EMD method was higher throughout all data sources as, unlike the Smart Fusion, the EMD method did not screen for inconsistent results. The study showed that it is feasible to estimate respiratory rates by placing a finger on a mobile phone camera, but that it becomes increasingly challenging at respiratory rates greater than 20 breaths/min, independent of data source or algorithm tested.",

    "abstract": "In this paper, a multi-product multi-chance constraint joint single-vendor multi-buyers inventory problem is considered in which the demand follows a uniform distribution, the lead-time is assumed to vary linearly with respect to the lot size, and the shortage in combination of backorder and lost-sale is assumed. Furthermore, the orders are placed in multiple of packets, there is a limited space available for the vendor, there are chance constraints on the vendor service rate to supply the products, and there is a limited budget for each buyer to purchase the products. While the elements of the buyers' cost function are holding, shortage, order and transportation costs, the set up and holding costs are assumed for the vendor. The goal is to determine the re-order point and the order quantity of each product for each buyer such that the chain total cost is minimized. We show the model of this problem to be a mixed integer nonlinear programming type and in order to solve it a particle swarm optimization (PSO) approach is used. To justify the results of the proposed PSO algorithm, a genetic algorithm (GA) is applied as well to solve the problem. Then, the quality of the results and the CPU times of reaching the solution are compared through three numerical examples that are given to demonstrate the applicability of the proposed methodology in real world inventory control problems. The comparison results show the PSO approach has better performances than the GA method.",

    "abstract": "In this paper, we study strong normalization of a core language based on System F-omega which supports programming with finite and infinite structures. Building on our prior work, finite data such as finite lists and trees are defined via constructors and manipulated via pattern matching, while infinite data such as streams and infinite trees is defined by observations and synthesized via copattern matching. In this work, we take a type-based approach to strong normalization by tracking size information about finite and infinite data in the type. This guarantees compositionality. More importantly, the duality of pattern and copatterns provide a unifying semantic concept which allows us for the first time to elegantly and uniformly support both well-founded induction and coinduction by mere rewriting. The strong normalization proof is structured around Girard's reducibility candidates. As such our system allows for non-determinism and does not rely on coverage. Since System F-omega is general enough that it can be the target of compilation for the Calculus of Constructions, this work is a significant step towards representing observation-centric infinite data in proof assistants such as Coq and Agda.",

    "abstract": "Commercially available magnetic tape units have longitudinal recording densities of up to 2000 bits per inch, whereas analog instrumentation recorders are capable of recording up to 10,000 cycles per inch. These figures contrast with a theoretical recording density limitation for iron oxide of 250,000 bits per inch, and the reasons for this discrepancy are analyzed. Two experimental systems having recording densities of 5000 and 10,000 bits per inch using analog recording techniques are described, Conclusions drawn from these experiments indicate that a density of 20,000 bits per inch should be possible using commercially available analog tape recording machines. Experimental machines indicate the practicability of densities on the order of 100,000 to 200,000 bits per inch, depending on the method of recording used.",

    "abstract": "Every summer, the Salanter Akiba Riverdale SAR Academy must create class placements for their elementary school students. Each grade of 80 to 100 students must be divided into four classes. In assigning students to classes, the school administration aims to foster a positive social and educational environment for students while satisfying placement requests and recommendations from parents, teachers, and school therapists. The school must satisfy several constraints such as not placing certain pairs of students in the same class or keeping boy/girl ratios balanced. The process of creating optimal class placements by hand can be laborious and difficult, especially for grades with many constraints to satisfy. This paper describes a model that is being used to assist SAR Academy with creating class placements. Following the constraints and objectives given by administrators at the school, we describe an integer-programming model for satisfying placement constraints and heuristics to further improve on the outputs of the integer-programming model. The results of this process were successfully used to assist administrators in assigning students in one grade for the 2012--13 school year, and SAR Academy plans to use the model for help with future class placements.",

    "abstract": "Data mining technology is used to extract useful knowledge from very large datasets, but the process of data collection and data dissemination may result in an inherent threat to privacy. Some sensitive or private information concerning individuals, businesses and organizations has to be suppressed before it is shared or published. Privacy-preserving data mining (PPDM) has become an important issue in recent years. In the past, many heuristic approaches were developed to sanitize databases for the purpose of hiding sensitive information in PPDM, but data sanitization of PPDM is considered to be an NP-hard problem. It is critical to find the balance between privacy protection for hiding sensitive information and maintaining the discovery of knowledge, or even reducing artificial knowledge in the sanitization process. In this paper, a GA-based framework with two optimization algorithms is proposed for data sanitization. A novel evaluation function with three concerned factors is designed to find the appropriate transactions to be deleted in order to hide sensitive itemsets. Experiments are then conducted to evaluate the performance of the proposed GA-based algorithms with regard to different factors such as the execution time, the number of hiding failures, the number of missing itemsets, the number of artificial itemsets, and database dissimilarity.",

Our registration method assigns greater importance to more salient voxels by applying a soft thresholding function to normalized saliency values. The resulting saliency map is a better representation of what is truly visually salient than an entropy-based saliency map. Our tests on real patient datasets show that incorporating this saliency measure produces better registration results than traditional entropy-based approaches.",

The authors propose that smartphones have changed telephones from a point-to-point interpersonal medium to a broadcast medium for individuals to disseminate information to their networks through the use of social media. The authors hypothesized that the more friends and followers a student has on Facebook and Twitter respectively, the more likely the student will use friends and followers as self-broadcasting mediums from their smartphones. The hypothesis was supported based on survey data collected at a public university. The study also discusses the social implications of using smartphones as a broadcast and self-promotion medium.",

    "abstract": "One way countries like the United States can comply with suggested rollbacks in greenhouse gas emissions is by employing power plants fueled with biomass. We examine the competitiveness of biomass\u2010based fuel for electrical power as opposed to coal using a mathematical programming structure. We consider fueling power plants from milling residues, whole trees, logging residues, switch grass, or short\u2010rotation woody crops. We do this using a combined model of the agricultural and forestry sectors. We find that the competitiveness of biomass depends in a key way upon the success of research in developing improved production methods for short\u2010rotation woody crops without great increases in costs.

    "abstract": "Internet and cellular technologies are merging to decrease transport costs and enable IP-based applications to hundreds of millions of cellular users. Real time voice services will continue to be dominant in future cellular systems and to reduce system costs it is desirable to base all services, including voice, on IP. However, the radio spectrum must be efficiently used to provide mass-market services at reasonable prices, but Internet protocol headers are large in size. Moreover, data discarding policies are poorly suited to the error-proneness of cellular links. Protocol overhead for IP-based voice services can be reduced by compressing headers, e.g. with the compressed real time protocol (CRTP). CRTP, however, does not perform well over cellular links since it is not robust in the face of errors. ROCCO, a header compression scheme suitable for cellular systems, delivers more packets to the user than CRTP at realistic error rates with a better average compression ratio. Voice services in cellular systems should also be able to use damaged speech data. This can be done using the UDP Lite protocol which provides a more flexible checksumming policy that enables delivery of data possibly usable to the application. This paper shows that CRTP/UDP fails to deliver sufficient service quality at the error rates of a cost-efficient cellular system and that ROCCO combined with UDP Lite can provide an IP-based voice service over such cellular systems.",

The algorithm is based on transforming multi-dimensional service processes in the system into a one-dimensional discrete Markov chain, which is characterised by a product form solution. Special attention is paid to the method for determining reverse transition rates and state probabilities in this Markov chain. The results of analytical calculations of the blocking probability are compared with the results of digital simulation of systems with bandwidth reservation. This research has shown a better accuracy of the proposed method as compared to the accuracy of other known solutions.

We showed that people could systematically judge the subjective roughness of these textures. However, we did not determine which objective factors relate to these perceptual judgments of roughness. In the present study we take the first step in this direction using a subband decomposition of the CUReT textures. This subband decomposition is used to predict the subjective roughness judgments of the previous study. We also generated synthetic textures with uniformly distributed white noise of the same variance in each subband, and conducted a perceptual experiment to determine the perceived roughness of both the original and synthesized texture images. The participants were asked to rank-order the images based on the degree of perceived roughness. It was found that the synthesis method produces images that are similar in roughness to the original ones except for a small but systematic deviation.",

The paper presents a new integer one-pass algorithm for this problem. In 2D, the proposed approach is based on a modification of the well-known Bresenham algorithm. The algorithm is then extended in 3D where a special case may occur. It is characterized by a simple discriminator. A derivation for this discriminator given in the paper confirms that all calculations can be realized using only integer arithmetic. In this way, the accumulation of rounding errors is completely eliminated, and a robust and compact implementation can be easily achieved. One of the main advantages of the proposed algorithm is that it visits 1\u20133 voxels during each iteration thus assuring its efficiency. The algorithm has been compared with other algorithms for voxel traversing by measuring spent CPU time. For comparison, Cleary & Wyvill's, Amanatides & Woo's, and Code-based algorithm have been used. The proposed algorithm is faster than the referenced algorithms.",

    "abstract": "Cloud computing provides promising scalable IT infrastructure to support various processing of a variety of big data applications in sectors such as healthcare and business. Data sets like electronic health records in such applications often contain privacy-sensitive information, which brings about privacy concerns potentially if the information is released or shared to third-parties in cloud. A practical and widely-adopted technique for data privacy preservation is to anonymize data via generalization to satisfy a given privacy model. However, most existing privacy preserving approaches tailored to small-scale data sets often fall short when encountering big data, due to their insufficiency or poor scalability. In this paper, we investigate the local-recoding problem for big data anonymization against proximity privacy breaches and attempt to identify a scalable solution to this problem. Specifically, we present a proximity privacy model with allowing semantic proximity of sensitive values and multiple sensitive attributes, and model the problem of local recoding as a proximity-aware clustering problem. A scalable two-phase clustering approach consisting of a  t -ancestors clustering (similar to  k -means) algorithm and a proximity-aware agglomerative clustering algorithm is proposed to address the above problem. We design the algorithms with MapReduce to gain high scalability by performing data-parallel computation in cloud. Extensive experiments on real-life data sets demonstrate that our approach significantly improves the capability of defending the proximity privacy breaches, the scalability and the time-efficiency of local-recoding anonymization over existing approaches.",

High-rate rendering and communication between collaborating users quickly leads to performance bottlenecks, if the virtual environment's size and complexity or the number of collaborating users increases. We propose a decentralized communication architecture for SHVEs, which exploits areas of interest (AoI) of a user to dynamically form smaller communication groups. High-rate information exchange following the client-server paradigm is used within these groups to support satisfactory haptic collaboration and consistency. A single group member is selected to simulate the object states and to relay this state to the other group members. Peer-to-peer inter-group communication is also used, based on spatial proximity, to further reduce the overall communication load. We implemented a prototype based on our proposed architecture and present some first evaluation results. They serve as a proof-of-concept and show the effectiveness of dynamic group maintenance in conjunction with additional traffic control schemes.",

    "abstract": "We present FComp, a system for automatic generation of harmony and accompanying melody. Building on previous work on functional modelling of musical harmony, FComp first creates a foundational harmony by generating random (but user-guided) values of a datatype that encodes the rules of tonal harmony. Then, a melody that fits to the harmony is generated in a compositional sequence: generate all \"possible\" melodies, filter them to remove obvious bad choices, pick one candidate note per chord, and then embellish the resulting melodic line.   At this very early stage, we aim to define a solid system as a foundation that can be used to further improve upon. We care especially about modularity, so that each individual part of the pipeline can be easily improved, and ease of adaptation, so that users can quickly adapt the generated music to their liking. The resulting system generates simple but harmonious music, and serves as a good case study on how functional programming enables quick and clean prototyping of new ideas, even in the realm of automatic music composition.",

    "abstract": "Textual Feature Selection (TFS) is an important phase in the process of text classification. It aims to identify the most significant textual features (i.e. key words and/or phrases), in a textual dataset, that serve to distinguish between text categories. In TFS, basic techniques can be divided into two groups: linguistic vs. statistical. For the purpose of building a language-independent text classifier, the study reported here is concerned with statistical TFS only. In this paper, we propose a novel statistical TFS approach that hybridizes the ideas of two existing techniques, DIAAF (Darmstadt Indexing Approach Association Factor) and RS (Relevancy Score). With respect to associative (text) classification, the experimental results demonstrate that the proposed approach can produce greater classification accuracy than other alternative approaches.",

    "abstract": "The paper documents a computational design and an experimental verification of a vibration rejection scheme for an inertially stabilized platform mounted on a mobile base. The mechanical configuration of the platform is that of a standard double gimbal, which realizes a mass stabilization of the line of sight of an optoelectronic payload such as a camera an/or laser ranger finder. Nonideal static balancing of the payload gives rise to projection of the carrier vibrations onto a disturbing torque acting on the payload around the joint axes. This disturbance can be left for the existing inertial angular rate feedback to attenuate but a better solution can be devised. The cause of this disturbing torque \u2014 the linear acceleration of the carrier \u2014 can be measured, filtered and fed forward to the two direct drive motors. Experiments prove that significant vibration rejection is achieved with this feedforward compensation scheme.",

In this work, a large number of scenarios are constructed by considering combinations of possible realizations of the uncertain economic factors such as energy cost profile, emission penalty and value of captured CO2. Then, the design choices like the size of the storage tanks and the regeneration capacity are optimized by minimizing an overall cost averaged over all the scenarios. The optimal design problem is naturally formulated as a two-stage stochastic program. This multi-scenario optimal design is compared with the design that minimizes the overall cost for just a single nominal scenario as well as the design that minimizes the cost averaged over the worst-case scenarios.",

Zero-pronouns are a special kind of anaphora, whose resolution also lies in ellipsis phenomenon since they do not appear explicitly in the text. They must first be detected (ellipsis), and then resolved just like any other pronoun (anaphora). This kind of pronoun occurs in Spanish texts when they occupy the grammatical position of the subject. In this paper, we propose an approach that resolves zero-pronouns in Spanish texts and subsequently generates them into English.

    "abstract": "Recently, several steganographic algorithms for two-color binary images have been proposed[16,1,14,2]. In this paper, we propose steganographic algorithms which embeds a secret message into bitmap images and palette-based images. To embed a message, the suggested algorithm divides a bitmap image into bit-plane images from LSB-plane to MSB-plane for each pixel, and considers each bit-plane image as a binary one. The algorithm splits each bit-plane image into m x n blocks, and embeds a r-bit(r = ?log 2 (mn+1)?-1) message into the block. And our schemes embed a message to every bit-plane from LSB to MSB to maximize the amount of embedded message and to minimize the degradation. The schemes change at most two pixels in each block. Therefore, the maximal color changes of the new algorithm are much smaller than other bit-plane embedding schemes' such as the sequential substitution schemes[10,7,11].",

It exploits the redundancy present in the protocol stack to determine the packet type which is the most probable a posteriori. An optimal and a suboptimal estimation algorithm are presented. The latter is illustrated on the type estimation of packets compressed with the Robust Header Compression algorithm in unidirectional mode. Compared to a classical packet type estimation technique, improvements of more than 3:9 dB are observed in terms of channel SNR at header error rates of 10 2 . 1",

    "abstract": "Background#R##N#Chronic neuropathic pain is one of the most common and disabling symptoms in individuals with spinal cord injury (SCI). Over two-thirds of subjects with SCI suffer from chronic pain influencing quality of life, rehabilitation, and recovery. Given the refractoriness of chronic pain to most pharmacological treatments, the majority of individuals with SCI report worsening of this condition over time. Moreover, only 4\u20136% of patients in this cohort report improvement. Novel treatments targeting mechanisms associated with pain-maladaptive plasticity, such as electromagnetic neural stimulation, may be desirable to improve outcomes. To date, few, small clinical trials have assessed the effects of invasive and noninvasive nervous system stimulation on pain after SCI.#R##N#Objective#R##N#We aimed to review initial efficacy, safety and potential predictors of response by assessing the effects of neural stimulation techniques to treat SCI pain.#R##N#Search strategy#R##N#A literature search was performed using the PubMed database including studies using the following targeted stimulation strategies: transcranial Direct Current Stimulation (tDCS), High Definition tDCS (HD-tDCS), repetitive Transcranial Magnetical Stimulation (rTMS), Cranial Electrotherapy Stimulation (CES), Transcutaneous Electrical Nerve Stimulation (TENS), Spinal Cord Stimulation (SCS) and Motor Cortex Stimulation (MCS), published prior to June of 2012. We included studies from 1998 to 2012.#R##N#Results#R##N#Eight clinical trials and one naturalistic observational study (nine studies in total) met the inclusion criteria. Among the clinical trials, three studies assessed the effects of tDCS, two of CES, two of rTMS and one of TENS. The naturalistic study investigated the analgesic effects of SCS. No clinical trials for epidural motor cortex stimulation (MCS) or HD-tDCS were found. Parameters of stimulation and also clinical characteristics varied significantly across studies. Three out of eight studies showed larger effects sizes (0.73, 0.88 and 1.86 respectively) for pain reduction. Classical neuropathic pain symptoms such as dysesthesia (defined as an unpleasant burning sensation in response to touch), allodynia (pain due to a non-painful stimulus), pain in paroxysms, location of SCI in thoracic and lumbar segments and pain in the lower limbs seem to be associated with a positive response to neural stimulation. No significant adverse effects were reported in these studies.#R##N#Conclusions#R##N#Chronic pain in SCI is disabling and resistant to common pharmacologic approaches. Electrical and magnetic neural stimulation techniques have been developed to offer a potential tool in the management of these patients. Although some of these techniques are associated with large standardized mean differences to reduce pain, we found an important variability in these results across studies. There is a clear need for the development of methods to decrease treatment variability and increase response to neural stimulation for pain treatment. We discuss potential methods such as neuroimaging or EEG-guided neural stimulation and the development of better surrogate markers of response such as TMS-indexed cortical plasticity.",

    "abstract": "Synapses of the mammalian central nervous system are highly diverse in function and molecular composition. Synapse diversity per se may be critical to brain function, since memory and homeostatic mechanisms are thought to be rooted primarily in activity-dependent plastic changes in specific subsets of individual synapses. Unfortunately, the measurement of synapse diversity has been restricted by the limitations of methods capable of measuring synapse properties at the level of individual synapses. Array tomography is a new high-resolution, high-throughput proteomic imaging method that has the potential to advance the measurement of unit-level synapse diversity across large and diverse synapse populations. Here we present an automated feature extraction and classification algorithm designed to quantify synapses from high-dimensional array tomographic data too voluminous for manual analysis. We demonstrate the use of this method to quantify laminar distributions of synapses in mouse somatosensory cortex and validate the classification process by detecting the presence of known but uncommon proteomic profiles. Such classification and quantification will be highly useful in identifying specific subpopulations of synapses exhibiting plasticity in response to perturbations from the environment or the sensory periphery.",

    "abstract": "We describe a novel method for calculating the quasi-static electrical potential on tetrahedral meshes, which we call E-Field. The E-Field method is implemented in STEPS, which performs stochastic spatial reaction-diffusion computations in tetrahedral-based cellular geometry reconstructions. This provides a level of integration between electrical excitability and spatial molecular dynamics in realistic cellular morphology not previously achievable. Deterministic solutions are also possible. By performing the Rallpack tests we demonstrate the accuracy of the E-Field method. Efficient node ordering is an important practical consideration, and we find that a breadth-first search provides the best solutions, although principal axis ordering suffices for some geometries. We discuss potential applications and possible future directions, and predict that the E-Field implementation in STEPS will play an important role in the future of multiscale neural simulations.",

    "abstract": "Previous works on buffer management in the database area paid little attention to the dynamic buffer allocation involving reallocation of buffers of queries while exploiting the known access patterns of the database operations. This paper proposes a new buffer allocation technique to improve the system's global performance. The main idea is to maximize the effectiveness of the buffer allocation. For this end, the less-utilized buffers of queries are partially preempted and reallocated to the other queries which can utilize them more effectively. The proposed technique reduces the waiting time portion of query processing through the flexible buffer allocation. The simulation results show that the proposed technique performs better than the conventional ones.",

Using the right combination of voltage and time domain information, the proposed ADC architecture benefits from improved resolution and power efficiency, with MSBs resolved in voltage domain and LSBs in time domain. The measured results of the prototype ADC implemented in a 0.13 \u03bcm CMOS demonstrate peak SNDR of 69.3 dB at 6.38 mW power and 70 MHz sampling frequency.

    "abstract": "The restoration and preservation of ancient documents is becoming an interesting application in document image analysis. This paper introduces a novel approach aimed at segmenting the graphical part in historical heritage called lettrine and extracting its signatures in order to develop a Content-Based Image Retrieval (CBIR) system. The research principle is established on the concept of invariant texture analysis (Co-occurrence and Run-length matrices, Autocorrelation function and Wold decomposition) and signature extraction (Mininum Spanning Tree and Pairwise Geometric Attributes). The experimental results are presented by highlighting difficulties related to the nature of strokes and textures in lettrine. The signatures extracted from segmented areas of interest are informative enough to gain a reliable CBIR system.",

    "abstract": "Sociological theory has always been a theory on the network synthesis of social action. In this age of society intrigued by the introduction of computers, this has to become explicit. To know about the form of the network synthesis of social action means to know how the society, which will cease to be modern and become, instead, the next one, a knowledge society, deals with its inherent dynamics by generating specific structures able to sustain social action. This paper attempts to look more closely at the network synthesis of social action from two perspectives. Firstly it goes back to Niklas Luhmann's conjecture about the structures of society depending mainly on culture forms able to deal with the surplus meaning, or overflow, produced by the introduction of new media for the dissemination of communication. This is a conjecture about the structures of society being the outcome of it having to find a solution to new kinds of overflow by switching from one culture form, and the concomitant social structure, order, and understanding , to another. The morphogenesis of society depends on these dissemination media eclipsing one another, while all however persisting, even if changed in scope, scale, and range. The paper, then, tries to develop a model of social action which takes into account the culture form possibly able to deal with the surplus meaning brought about by the introduction of the computer as a medium for the dissemination of communication. This model proposes a form integrating ideas from sociological systems theory and sociological network theory. It tries to be simple enough to accommodate the complexity of social action.",

For that purpose it is needed to measure different biometric parameters from the user and additionally measure the interaction between endovascular instruments and vasculature models membrane. For that purpose in this research we present an optical sensor for encoding linear and rotational motion of the catheter through the insertion port. Additionally we present two studies for measuring tissue integrity, time to complete a task, reaction time, and wasting motion using two populations of expert and beginner. The optical encoder showed an average error of 0.39mm and 10.78deg. In both studies the presented cyber-physical system is useful to identify the users with qualities closer to the expert among users with low performance.",

This tool plays a central role in the analysis and the numerical solution of convex optimization problems. It has recently been introduced in the area of signal processing, where it has become increasingly important. However, so far there has been no research on independent component analysis (ICA) in this framework. In this paper, we focus on this problem and propose the fast proximal-gradient method for ICA, termed as FastPG-ICA, in blind source separation (BSS) problem. We derive the new update rule of the unmixing matrix from the viewpoint of the fast proximal gradient. It achieves a better separation performance than that of the traditional ICA method, such as complex FastICA (cFastICA) proposed by Bingham and Hyvarinen.

    "abstract": "The means of distributing dense passive radio-frequency identification (RFID) tags has been widely utilized for accurate indoor localization. However, they suffer a disadvantage on low localization precision due to the increasing interference of RFID tag collisions and the variation of behavior of tags. Current localization algorithms used in passive RFID location systems are mostly deterministic and have a limited capability on improving localization precision in a dynamic environment with uncertain sensor measurement. This paper investigates the feasibility of using particle filter technique as an efficient localization approach to deliver both relatively good accuracy and precision in dense passive RFID tag distribution applications. A position feature-based system model is first built to apply the typical particle filter technique in passive RFID location applications. Then, a new particle filter algorithm by using a moving direction estimation-based feature improvement scheme is proposed to enhance localization precision in a dense passive RFID tag environment. Experimental results show that the proposed method can provide relatively good accuracy and precision for passive RFID location applications, with an improved performance over the typical particle filter algorithm and a state-of-the-art deterministic method.",

Passive systems generally have good resolution only in bearing and only can detect objects that emit acoustic energy. By fusing measurements from both types of systems, the passive data can be used to reduce the clutter in the active data. The result is improved target tracking, as shown in two examples, including the injection of a single target into a recorded active clutter dataset.",

The system was developed in OCaml and now it can be executed inside the Emacs editor within a new mode which allows a very easy interaction. The use of special symbols makes its application very useful for students because the notation on the screen is as close as possible to that on the paper. In addition to dealing the @l-calculus and explicit substitutions calculi in de Bruijn notation, now it is possible to work with the @l-calculus and with several calculi of explicit substitutions using also representation of variables with names. Moreover, in contrast to the original version of the system, that was restricted to three specific calculi of explicit substitution, the new version allows the inclusion of new calculi by giving as input their grammatical descriptions. SUBSEXPL has been used with success for teaching basic properties of the @l-calculus and for illustrating the computational impact of selecting one kind of representation of variables (either names or indices) and a specific style of making explicit substitutions in real implementations based on the @l-calculus.",

    "abstract": "With the dynamic and mobile nature of ad hoc wireless networks, links may fail due to topological changes by mobile nodes. As the degree of mobility increases, the wireless network would suffer more link errors. Ad hoc routing protocols that use broadcast to discover routes may become inefficient due to frequent failures of intermediate connections in an end-to-end communication. When an intermediate link breaks, it is beneficial to discover a new route locally without resorting to an end-to-end route discovery. Based on the concept of localizing the route request query, we propose an efficient approach to repair error links quickly. The approach can apply to the ad hoc on-demand distance vector (AODV) routing protocol. As an enhancement to AODV, the proposed approach leads to two routing protocols, called AODV-LRQ and AODV-LRT, which are aimed to efficiently repair the link errors. To evaluate the effects of the route repair, we define a factor, called bonus gain, as the ratio between the throughput increment to the routing overhead increment. Simulation results show that the proposed methods can get high bonus gain, that is, it can maintain the throughput as well as reduce the routing overheads.",

Optimizing different representations for different data domains is infeasible in a practical setting on the Internet. Mining such representations from the data in an unsupervised manner is desirable. In this paper, we study a representation based on the multi-scale harmonic analysis of term-term co-occurrence graph. This representation is not only sparse, but also leads to the discovery of semantically coherent topics in data. In our experiments on user-generated short documents e.g., newsgroup messages, user comments, and meta-data, we found this representation to outperform other representations across different choice of classifiers. Similar improvements were also observed for data sets in Chinese and Portuguese languages.",

In the case analysed in the present paper a peculiar aspect was the necessity to effectively assess new operational procedures and tools. In particular we exploited an integrated methodology to evaluate computer-based applications and their interactions with the operational environment. Current ATC safety practices, methodologies, guidelines and standards were critically revised, in order to identify how they could be applied to the project under consideration. Thus specific problematic areas for the safety assessment in a pre-operational experimental project are highlighted and, on the basis of theoretical principles, some possible solutions taken into consideration. The latter are described highlighting the rationale of most relevant decisions, in order to provide guidance for generalisation or re-use.",

    "abstract": "In this paper we propose an approach to retrieve the absolute geometry of an acoustic sensor network, consisting of spatially distributed microphone arrays, from reverberant speech input. The calibration relies on direction of arrival measurements of the individual arrays. The proposed calibration algorithm is derived from a maximum-likelihood approach employing circular statistics. Since a sensor node consists of a microphone array with known intra-array geometry, we are able to obtain an absolute geometry estimate, including angles and distances. Simulation results demonstrate the effectiveness of the approach.",

    "abstract": "Shape-generic programming and high run time performance do match if generic source code is systematically specialised into nongeneric executable code. However, as soon as we drop the assumption of whole-world knowledge or refrain from specialisation for other reasons, compiled generic code is substantially less efficient. Limited effectiveness of code optimisation techniques due to the inherent lack of knowledge about the structural properties of arrays can be identified as the single most important source of inefficiency.#R##N##R##N#However, in many cases partial structural information or structural relationships between arrays would actually suffice for optimisation. We propose symbolic array attributes as a uniform scheme to infer and to represent partial and relational structural information in shape-generic array code. By reusing the regular language to express structural properties in intermediate code, existing optimisations benefit from symbolic array attributes with little or no alteration. In fact, program optimisation and identification of structural properties cross-fertilise each other. We outline our approach in the context of the functional array language SaC and demonstrate its effectiveness by a small case study.",

The artificial fingertip is constructed around a deformable spherical membrane filled with a cellulose sponge, itself connected to a rigid structure that acts as a bone. Force-deformation characteristics and response to a transient mechanical perturbation are both shown to be in good qualitative agreement with those of a real finger. More importantly, the fingertip exhibits friction reduction when interacting with TPads (variable friction tactile displays based on transverse ultrasonic vibrations). Comparison with artificial fingertips that do not exhibit friction reduction suggests that mechanical damping characteristics play a key role in the amount of friction reduction achieved.",

    "abstract": "Nowadays, noninvasive methods of diagnosis have increased due to demands of the population that requires fast, simple and painless exams. These methods have become possible because of the growth of technology that provides the necessary means of collecting and processing signals. New methods of analysis have been developed to understand the complexity of voice signals, such as nonlinear dynamics aiming at the exploration of voice signals dynamic nature. The purpose of this paper is to characterize healthy and pathological voice signals with the aid of relative entropy measures. Phase space reconstruction technique is also used as a way to select interesting regions of the signals. Three groups of samples were used, one from healthy individuals and the other two from people with nodule in the vocal fold and Reinke\u2019s edema. All of them are recordings of sustained vowel /a/ from Brazilian Portuguese. The paper shows that nonlinear dynamical methods seem to be a suitable technique for voice signal analysis, due to the chaotic component of the human voice. Relative entropy is well suited due to its sensibility to uncertainties, since the pathologies are characterized by an increase in the signal complexity and unpredictability. The results showed that the pathological groups had higher entropy values in accordance with other vocal acoustic parameters presented. This suggests that these techniques may improve and complement the recent voice analysis methods available for clinicians.",

However, enterprise and cloud computing domains, where resource isolation of multiple clients is required, have poor access to GPU technology. This is due to lack of operating system (OS) support for virtualizing GPUs in a reliable manner. To make GPUs more mature system citizens, we present an open architecture of GPU virtualization with a particular emphasis on the Xen hypervisor. We provide design and implementation of full- and para-virtualization, including optimization techniques to reduce overhead of GPU virtualization. Our detailed experiments using a relevant commodity GPU show that the optimized performance of GPU para-virtualization is yet two or three times slower than that of pass-through and native approaches, whereas full-virtualization exhibits a different scale of overhead due to increased memory-mapped I/O operations. We also demonstrate that coarse-grained fairness on GPU resources among multiple virtual machines can be achieved by GPU scheduling; finer-grained fairness needs further architectural support by the nature of non-preemptive GPU workload.",

We prove the existence of an ELE (where the desired value is the expected payoff in a Nash equilibrium) and of a Pareto-ELE (where the objective is the maximization of social surplus) in repeated games with perfect monitoring. We also show that an ELE does not always exist in the imperfect monitoring case. Finally, we discuss the extension of these results to general-sum stochastic games.",

    "abstract": "In this paper, we approach the problem of real-time filtering in the Twitter Microblogging platform. We adapt an effective traditional news filtering technique, which uses a text classifier inspired by Rocchio's relevance feedback algorithm, to build and dynamically update a profile of the user's interests in real-time. In our adaptation, we tackle two challenges that are particularly prevalent in Twitter: sparsity and drift. In particular, sparsity stems from the brevity of tweets, while drift occurs as events related to the topic develop or the interests of the user change. First, to tackle the acute sparsity problem, we apply query expansion to derive terms or related tweets for a richer initialisation of the user interests within the profile. Second, to deal with drift, we modify the user profile to balance between the importance of the short-term interests, i.e. emerging subtopics, and the long-term interests in the overall topic. Moreover, we investigate an event detection method from Twitter and newswire streams to predict times at which drift may happen. Through experiments using the TREC Microblog track 2012, we show that our approach is effective for a number of common filtering metrics such as the user's utility, and that it compares favourably with state-of-the-art news filtering baselines. Our results also uncover the impact of different factors on handling topic drifting.",

    "abstract": "The H.264 video coding standard can achieve considerably higher coding efficiency than previous standards. The key to this high code efficiency are mainly the Intra and Inter prediction modes provided by the standard. However, the compression efficiency of the H264 standard comes at the cost of increased complexity of the encoder. Therefore it is very important to design video architectures that minimize the cost of the prediction modes in terms of area, power dissipation and design complexity. A common aspect of the Inter and Intra Prediction modes, is the Sum of Absolute Differences (SAD). In this paper we present a new algorithm that can replace the SAD in Intra Prediction, and which provides a more efficient hardware implementation.",

    "abstract": "The class ACC consists of circuit families with constant depth over unbounded fan-in AND, OR, NOT, and MOD m  gates, where  m  > 1 is an arbitrary constant. We prove the following.   ---NEXP, the class of languages accepted in nondeterministic exponential time, does not have nonuniform ACC circuits of polynomial size. The size lower bound can be slightly strengthened to quasipolynomials and other less natural functions.   ---E NP , the class of languages recognized in 2 O(n)  time with an NP oracle, doesn\u2019t have nonuniform ACC circuits of 2 n  o(1)  size. The lower bound gives an exponential size-depth tradeoff: for every  d, m  there is a  \u0394  > 0 such that E NP  doesn\u2019t have depth- d  ACC circuits of size 2 n  \u0394  with MOD m  gates.   Previously, it was not known whether EXP NP  had depth-3 polynomial-size circuits made out of only MOD 6  gates. The high-level strategy is to design faster algorithms for the circuit satisfiability problem over ACC circuits, then prove that such algorithms entail these lower bounds. The algorithms combine known properties of ACC with fast rectangular matrix multiplication and dynamic programming, while the second step requires a strengthening of the author\u2019s prior work.",

The results of experiments indicate that the LLR gives better performance than the SLR for longer training data of 5 or more sentences, and the SLR measure is better for shorter training data. When 10 sentences are used for training, identification and verification rates (after likelihood normalization) are almost the same as those obtained by an HMM-based method. The optimum order of the MAR model is 2 or 3, and the optimum frame period is 16 ms. >",

In papers in which these methods are proposed, only qualitative analyze or examples are shown that demonstrate the usefulness of anonymized data, which are the outputs of those methods. Since it is generally said that, if the size of data gets bigger, the anonymization of data becomes easier, those methods have not been applied to real huge data. In this paper, we transform the travel records of 722,000 people traveling by train in the Tokyo area with our proposed anonymization methods, analyze the degree to which each of the results is useful, and conclude that the results are useless even when anonymity level is set to low.",

This article presents the development of a functional application for generating automatic life cycle assessments for web sites based on mashing-up information. This application has the aim of making the impact of websites visible, allowing the instant analysis of their carbon footprint using existing analytics data and presenting it in an understandable and transparent way. The development process is presented with detailed information about how the calculations are performed. The results are discussed around two different cases, focusing on the challenges of calculating the server side impact and the possibilities for improvement.",

    "abstract": "Through a study of Web site design practice, we observed that designers employ multiple representations of Web sites as they progress through the design process and that these representations allow them to focus on different aspects of the design. In particular, we observed that Web site designers focus their design efforts at 3 different levels of granularity--site map, storyboard, and individual page--and that designers sketch at all levels during the early stages of design. Sketching on paper is especially important during the early phases of a project, when designers wish to explore many design possibilities quickly without focusing on low-level details. Existing Web design tools do not support such exploration tasks well, nor do they adequately integrate multiple site representations. Informed by these observations we developed DENIM: an informal Web site design tool that supports early phase information and navigation design of Web sites. It supports sketching input, allows design at different levels of granularity, and unifies the levels through zooming. Designers are able to interact with their sketched designs as if in a Web browser, thus allowing rapid creation and exploration of interactive prototypes. Based on an evaluation with professional designers as well as usage feedback from users who have downloaded DENIM from the Internet, we have made numerous improvements to the system and have received many positive reactions from designers who would like to use a system like DENIM in their work.",

A single-server queue is considered in which the usual probabilistic assumptions are not assumed to hold. Only the existence of long-term averages of inter-arrival times and service times is assumed. Based on these minimal assumptions, stability conditions are established. The asymptotic behavior of the unstable queue is determined. In addition, an investigation of the stable queue is undertaken. Topics include queues with failures and asymptotic birth-and-death equations.",

A genetic algorithm is applied to solve this problem efficiently. Thus no matter the problem is planning the timetable of trains, the unusual passenger flow occurrence or the incident caused delay, our model will make the train regulation as the same as the timetable construction. This will simplify the work of administration. Our model also shows that once the delay occurred, the waiting time of the passengers will be the cost to delay every train. If the delay is not large enough, the system can have some rooms for removing the influence of the delay through our model.",

    "abstract": "Abstract This article investigates patterns of reasons for digital disengagement of British adults. It adds a psychological dimension to research that is mostly sociological in nature in trying to separate out explanations for disengaging from the Internet by choice or by forced exclusion. The analysis of a nationally representative survey shows differences between the number of reasons and the most important reasons among different sociodemographic groups, but also among individuals with different psychological profiles. The findings suggest that ex- and nonusers do not have one simple reason for nonuse, but a multifaceted range of reasons, which often represent disadvantages at several levels. The range of often mentioned reasons, moreover, shows that motivations for disengagement cannot be measured by means of the most important reason, but that all reasons have to be taken into account and looked at concertedly.",

First, the motivation for the development is shown, which is placed in the field of processing tools for photogrammetric evaluation tasks. As the use and availability of metric images of digital type rapidly increases corresponding equipment for the measuring process is needed. Systems which have been developed up to now are either very special ones, founded on high end graphics workstations with an according pricing or simple ones with restricted measuring functionality. A new conception will be shown, avoiding special high end graphics hardware but providing a complete processing chain for all elementary photogrammetric tasks ranging from preparatory steps over the formation of image blocks up to the automatic and interactive 3D-evaluation within digital stereo models. The presented system is based on PC-hardware equipped with off the shelf graphics boards and uses an object oriented design. The specific needs of a flexible measuring system and the corresponding requirements which have to be met by the system are shown. Important aspects as modularity and hardware independence and their value for the solution are shown.

    "abstract": "A fundamental scientific question today is how to construct complex systems from simple parts. Science today seems mostly to analyze limited pieces of the puzzle; the combination of these pieces to form a whole is left for later or others. The lack of efficient methods to deal with the combination problem is likely the main reason. How to combine individual results is a dominant question in cognitive science or geography, where phenomena are studied from individuals and at different scales, but the results cannot be brought together. This paper proposes to use parameterized algebras much the same way that we use functional abstraction (procedures in programming languages) to create abstract building blocks which can be combined later. Algebras group operations (which are functional abstractions) and can be combined to construct more complex algebras. Algebras operate therefore at a higher level of abstraction. A table shows the parallels between procedural abstraction and the abstraction by parameterized algebras. This paper shows how algebras can be combined to form more complex pieces and compares the steps to the combination of procedures in programming. The novel contribution is to parameterize algebras and make them thus ready for reuse. The method is first explained with the familiar construction of vector space and then applied to a larger example, namely the description of geometric operations for GIS, as proposed in the current draft standard document ISO 15046 Part 7: Spatial Schema. It is shown how operations can be grouped, reused, and combined, and useful larger systems built from the pieces. The paper compares the method to combine algebras - which are independent of an implementation - with the current use of object-orientation in programming languages (and in the UML notation often used for specification). The widely used 'structural' (or subset) polymorphism is justified by implementation considerations, but not appropriate for theory development and abstract specifications for standardization. Parametric polymorphism used for algebras avoids the contravariance of function types (which its semantically confusing consequences). Algebraic methods relate cleanly to the mathematical category theory and the method translates directly to modern functional programming or Java.",

The fulfilment of such requirements will directly impact on quality of service and customer satisfaction. In order to deal with this problem, one can create different classes of customers, according to their requirements. Considering the availability of many technologies, with different capacities and costs, proper topologies can be designed to meet all the requirements, minimizing costs implied by the necessary infrastructure.

    "abstract": "Cancelable biometrics and secure sketches have been introduced with the same purpose in mind: to protect the privacy of biometric templates while keeping the ability to match this protected data against a reference. The paradigm beyond cancelable biometrics is to perform an irreversible transformation over images and to make matching over transformed images. On one hand, a drawback of this technique is that for biometrics using a matching algorithm relying on some complex characteristics, such as the ones used for fingerprints, the irreversible transformation tends to break the underlying structure, thus degrading the performance accuracy. On the other hand, for secure sketches, matching is reduced to an error correction and we show here that applying secure sketch error correction to cancelable biometrics allows one to keep good matching performance. Moreover, the security's advantages of both schemes adds up together.",

In our recent publication K. R. Arun, P. Prasad, 3-D kinematical conservation laws (KCL): evolution of a surface in R-3-in particular propagation of a nonlinear wavefront, Wave Motion 46 (2009) 293-311] we have developed a mathematical theory to study the successive positions and geometry of a 3-D weakly nonlinear wavefront by adding an energy transport equation to KCL. The 7 x 7 system of equations of this KCL based 3-D weakly nonlinear ray theory (WNLRT) is quite complex and explicit expressions for its two nonzero eigenvalues could not be obtained before. In this short note, we use two different methods: (i) the equivalence of KCL and ray equations and (ii) the transformation of surface coordinates, to derive the same exact expressions for these eigenvalues. The explicit expressions for nonzero eigenvalues are important also for checking stability of any numerical scheme to solve 3-D WNLRT. (C) 2010 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.",

    "abstract": "We study two variants of the classic knapsack problem, in which we need to place items of  different types  in multiple knapsacks; each knapsack has a limited capacity, and a bound on the number of different types of items it can hold: in the  class-constrained multiple knapsack problem (CMKP)  we wish to maximize the total number of packed items; in the  fair placement problem (FPP)  our goal is to place the same (large) portion from each set. We look for a perfect placement, in which both problems are solved optimally. We first show that the two problems are NP-hard; we then consider some special cases, where a perfect placement exists and can be found in polynomial time. For other cases, we give approximate solutions. Finally, we give a nearly optimal solution for the CMKP. Our results for the CMKP and the FPP are shown to provide efficient solutions for two fundamental problems arising in multimedia storage subsystems.",

LMNMF seeks a nonnegative subspace such that k nearest neighbors of each sample always belong to same class and samples from different classes are separated by a large margin. In the subspace, the local separation structure of data is explicit. The large-margin criterion leads to a new objective function, and a convergency provable multiplicative nonnegative updating rule is derived to learn the basis matrix and encoding vectors. Then, partial least squares regression (PLSR) learns the mapping from the original data to low dimensional representations in order to capture local separation information. PLSR offers a unified solution to out-of-sample extension problem. Extensive experimental results demonstrate LMNMF with PLSR leads significant improvements on classification than several other commonly used NMF-based algorithms.",

    "abstract": "The concept of model is widely used in the MDE approach in order to represent several software artifacts, which are handled by different development teams throughout the software life cycle. Management of these models requires the definition of a set of model management operators such as the composition operation. This is generally an operation, which is dedicated to merge a number of models in order to create one (or more) incorporated model and which depends on the application context. The current work focuses on the description of a formal approach for model composition where the composition is specified by a set of graph transformation rules over UML-compliant models. The semantics of our composition operator is defined using triple graph grammars (TGGs) formalism. Furthermore, we present a composition scheme interpreted by a three-steps composition process: matching, checking and merging.",

    "abstract": "Over the last two decades, robust optimization has emerged as a computationally attractive approach to formulate and solve single-stage decision problems affected by uncertainty. More recently, robust optimization has been successfully applied to multi-stage problems with continuous recourse. This paper takes a step towards extending the robust optimization methodology to problems with integer recourse, which have largely resisted solution so far. To this end, we approximate two-stage robust integer programs by their corresponding K-adaptability problems, in which the decision maker pre-commits to K second-stage policies here-and-now and implements the best of these policies once the uncertain parameters are observed. We study the approximation quality and the computational complexity of the K-adaptability problem, and we propose two mixed-integer linear programming reformulations that can be solved with off-the-shelf software. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our reformulations for stylized instances of supply chain design, vertex packing, route planning and capital budgeting problems.",

    "abstract": "It has been a challenging task to estimate optical flow for videos in which either foreground or background exhibits remarkable motion information (i.e., large displacement), or those with insufficient resolution due to artifacts like motion blur or noise. We present a novel optical flow algorithm, which approaches the above problem as solving the task of energy minimization, which exploits image data and smoothness terms at the superpixel level. Our proposed method can be considered as an extended mean-shift algorithm, which advances color and gradient information of superpixels across consecutive frames with smoothness guarantees. Since we do not require assumptions of linearlization during optimization (as standard optical flow approaches do), we are able to alleviate local minimum problems and thus produce improved estimation results. Empirical results on the MPI-Sintel video dataset verify the effectiveness of our proposed method.",

    "abstract": "We present a novel approach to separating pitched signals from single-channel mixtures by harmonic bandwidth companding. Recalling that in a short analysis window the harmonic waveform envelope conveys information about approximate amplitude and frequency time variations, we show that proper linear waveform envelope smoothing reduces frequency spread around the harmonics and thus compresses the harmonic bandwidth. Such an action largely relaxes worst-case separation scenarios, which are caused by large proportions of overlapped harmonics. The distortion in separated signals due to harmonic bandwidth compression is compensated by an inverse system--the harmonic bandwidth expander. The benefit of such an approach is that explicit classification in overlapped and non-overlapped harmonics is no longer needed. Moreover, the underlying signal model is linear-in-parameters which allows for an efficient estimation via linear least-squares. The results show that harmonic bandwidth companding significantly outperforms two state-of-the-art separation methods.",

    "abstract": "Optimal regulation of stochastically behaving agents is essential to achieve a robust aggregate behavior in a swarm of agents. How optimally these behaviors are controlled leads to the problem of designing optimal control architectures. In this paper, we propose a novel broadcast stochastic receding horizon control architecture as an optimal strategy for stabilizing a swarm of stochastically behaving agents. The goal is to design, at each time step, an optimal control law in the receding horizon control framework using collective system behavior as the only available feedback information and broadcast it to all agents to achieve the desired system behavior. Using probabilistic tools, a conditional expectation based predictive model is derived to represent the ensemble behavior of a swarm of independently behaving agents with multi-state transitions. A stochastic finite receding horizon control problem is formulated to stabilize the aggregate behavior of agents. Analytical and simulation results are presented for a two-state multi-agent system. Stability of the closed-loop system is guaranteed using the supermartingale theory. Almost sure (with probability 1) convergence of the closed-loop system to the desired target is ensured. Finally, conclusions are presented.",

    "abstract": "User-generated content such as online reviews in social media evolve rapidly over time. To better understand the social media content, users not only want to examine what the topics are, but also want to discover the topic evolution patterns. In this paper, we propose a Dynamic Online Hierarchical Dirichlet Process model (DOHDP) to discover the evolutionary topics for Chinese social texts. In our DOHDP model, the evolutionary processes of topics are considered as evolutions in two levels, i.e. inter-epoch level and intra-epoch level. In inter-epoch level, the corpus of each epoch is modeled with an online HDP topic model, and the social texts are generated in a sequence mode. In the intra-epoch level, the time dependencies of historical epochs are modeled with an exponential decay function in which more recent epochs have a relatively stronger influence on the model parameters than the earlier epoch. Furthermore, we implement our DOHDP model using a two-phase online variational algorithm. Through comparing our DOHDP model with other related topic models on Chinese social media dataset Tianya-80299, the experiment results show that DOHDP model provides the best performance for discovering the evolutionary topics of Chinese social texts.",

    "abstract": "ABSTRACT 3D video content is captured and created mainly in high resolution targeting big cinema or home TV screens. For 3D mobile devices, equipped with small-size auto-stereoscopic displays, such content has to be properly repurposed, preferably in real-time. The repurposing requires not only spatial resizing but also properly maintaining the output stereo disparity, as it should deliver realistic, pleasant and harmless 3D perception. In this paper, we propose an approach to adapt the disparity range of the source video to the comfort disparity zone of the target display. To achieve this, we adapt the scale and the aspect ratio of th e source video. We aim at maximizing the disparity range of the retargeted content within the comfort zone, and minimizing the letterboxing of the cropped content. The proposed algorithm consists of five stages. First, we analyse the display profile, which characterises what 3D content can be comfortably observed in the target display. Then, we perform fast disparity analysis of the input stereoscopic content. Instead of returnin g the dense disparity map, it returns an estimate of the disparity statistics (min, max, meanand variance) per frame. Additionally, we detect scene cuts, where sharp transitions in disparities occur. Based on the estimated input, and desired output disparity ranges, we derive the optimal cropping parameters and scale of the cropping window, which would yield the targeted disparity range and minimize the area of cropped and letterboxed content. Once the rescaling and cropping parameters are known, we perform resampling procedure using spline-based and perceptually optimized resampling (anti-aliasing) kernels, which have also a very efficient computational structure. Perceptual optimization is achieved through adjusting the cut-off frequency of the anti-aliasing filter with the throughput of the target display.

    "abstract": "Recognizing the need to improve the situation awareness of unmanned aircraft system pilots to surrounding air traffic, multiple operators of unmanned aircraft systems have begun to introduce Cockpit Displays of Traffic Information into their ground control stations. In some cases, these displays have been augmented with moving maps or synthetic vision to enhance the pilots\u2019 comprehension of the airspace. To identify and classify specific information and processing needs for Sense and Avoid functions, a 3-level framework is proposed for conflict awareness, analogous to existing frameworks for situation awareness. Existing traffic displays focus on the depiction of traffic (position, and sometimes also velocity and direction), leaving it to the pilot to determine whether a conflict exists now or somewhere in the future. In terms of the proposed framework for conflict awareness, such displays support a Level 1 conflict awareness. To achieve higher levels of conflict awareness, the pilot must be able to project the future states of the surrounding traffic and understand the consequences. This level of knowledge can assist the pilot in anticipating potential conflicts and then maneuvering to obviate a time-critical conflict from ever developing. This paper describes the development and implementation of a Cockpit Display of Traffic Information that supports a Level 3 conflict awareness through the use of conflict probing. To compensate for the inherent limitations of a plan-view Cockpit Display of Traffic Information in terms of providing directly interpretable information about the vertical dimension, a Vertical Profile Display is introduced as an additional situational awareness tool to assist the pilot in identifying and resolving conflicts. Finally, to demonstrate the utility of conflict probing and the Vertical Profile Display as part of a Conflict Prediction and Display System to allow pilot involvement in the Sense and Avoid function of self separation, the paper provides an example using a multi-intruder encounter.",

    "abstract": "Adaptive power control algorithms has been widely studied for interference reduction, base station radiation decrease and terminal battery saving in 3G cellular systems. We study some of the existent adaptive power control algorithms and we propose an evolution of these algorithms in the forward link. In the proposed algorithm, we try to maintain the intercell interference stable and to reduce intracell interference when it is possible. Therefore, the power control steps of mobiles requesting a power increase may be reduced to limit the total power increase if some constraints are verified. The proposed algorithm uses an adaptive step, which is updated using the instantaneous mobile power control command and the command history. Moreover, a stabilization zone above the SIR target is used to limit oscillations. The proposed algorithm has been compared to the 3GPP standardized power control and to a recently proposed adaptive power control. Simulation results has shown that the proposed algorithm decreases slightly the outage probability as the already proposed adaptive power control and reduces the power consumption.",

    "abstract": "This paper proposes a multi-camera surveillance framework based on multiple view geometry. We address the problem of object association and consistent labeling through exploring geometrical correspondences of objects, not only in sequential frames from a single camera view but also across multiple camera views. The cameras are geometrically related through joint combination of multi-camera calibration, ground plane homography constraint, and field-of-view lines. Object detection is implemented using an adaptive Gaussian mixture model, and thereafter the information obtained from different cameras is fused so that the same object shown in different views can be assigned a unique label. Meanwhile, a virtual top-view of ground plane is synthesized to explicitly display the corresponding location and label of each detected object within a designated area-of-interest.",

    "abstract": "The fuzzy logic method is applied to classification of mass spectra obtained with an imaging internal source Fourier transform mass spectrometer (I2LD-FTMS). Traditionally, an operator uses the relative abundance of ions with specific mass-to-charge (m/z) ratios to categorize spectra. An operator does this by comparing the spectrum of m/z versus abundance of an unknown sample against a library of spectra from known samples. Automated positioning and acquisition allow the I2LD-FTMS to acquire data from very large grids, which would require classification of up to 3600 spectra per hour to keep pace with the acquisition. The tedious job of classifying numerous spectra generated in an I2LD-FTMS imaging application can be replaced by a fuzzy rule base if the cues an operator uses can be encapsulated. Appropriate methods for assigning fuzzy membership values for inputs (e.g., mass spectrum abundances) and choice of fuzzy inference operators to translate linguistic antecedent into confidence values for the consequence (or in this case the classification) is followed by using the maximum confidence and a necessary minimum threshold for making a crisp decision. This paper also describes a method for gathering statistics on ions, which are not currently used in the rule base, but which may bemore\u00a0\u00bb candidates for making the rule base more accurate and complete or to form new rule bases based on data obtained from known samples. A spatial method for classifying spectra with low membership values, based on neighboring sample classifications, is also presented.\u00ab\u00a0less",

    "abstract": "Functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) data analysis is a challenging problem due to the underlying physiological complexity of the brain and the scanning process. From engineering perspective, the fMRI data analysis can be viewed as a system modelling problem. In this paper, assuming the fMRI signal as the output of an unknown linear time-invariant system, a spatiotemporal adaptive filter is proposed to model the spatial activation patterns as well as the haemodynamic response (HDR) to the event-related stimulus. The well-known least mean square adaptive algorithm is used for estimating the coefficients of the spatiotemporal filter. The proposed method is shown to be equivalent to the canonical correlation analysis method. It is then extended to multiple event type scenarios to estimate the HDRs of each event type. Results from simulated as well as real fMRI data show that these adaptive modelling schemes can capture the variations of the HDR at different regions of the brain and hence enhance the estimation accuracy of the activation patterns.",

    "abstract": "In this work we propose a fuzzy temporal constraint logic. First of all, we provide the formal language which will allow the expression of well-formed formulas related to the temporal events by means of temporal constraints. Secondly, we introduce a valid resolution principle in order to solve the queries in this logic. Finally, we will show that this resolution principle is a generalization of the resolution principle proposed for a possibilistic logic with fuzzy predicates (Dubois and Prade, Internat. J. Approx. Reason. 4 (1990) 1{21). All this will serve to reason within a context of the theoretical model of the temporal reasoning proposed by Marn and Barro (Fuzzy Temporal Constraint Network, FTCN) (Marn et al., Cybernet. Systems 25(2) (1994) 207{215). This model underlies a module for the resolution of temporal queries. This module belongs to a diagnostic and intelligent monitoring system of patients, based on temporal reasoning. The system is applied to the patients admitted in the Intensive Care Units with severe ischemic cardiopathy, submitted to continuous monitoring of the electrical and mechanical signals of the heart. However, what is exposed here in this document is not limited to a eld of application in particular, but instead, it is completely general. c 2001 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.",

    "abstract": "The RSA public-key cryptosystem is widely used to provide security protocols and services in the network communication. However, design and implementation of the RSA cryptosystem to meet the real-time requirements of embedded applications are challenging issues, due to the computation intensive characteristics of the RSA arithmetic operations and the limited resources in the embedded systems. Various implementation and optimization methods have been proposed for RSA algorithm. However, software execution of RSA on general-purpose processors usually suffers from slow execution speed; while application-specific integrated circuit (ASIC) based approaches are lack of flexibility. In this work, we present a systematic design approach of application-specific instruction-set processor(ASIP) for the RSA cryptographic algorithm. We identify and optimize the custom instructions in the RSA algorithm, and extend the instruction set architecture (ISA) of a standard 32-bit RISC processor to accommodate them. We employ the Electronic System Level (ESL) methodology in the development of the proposed ASIP in the Xilinx Virtex5 LX110T FPGA platform. Compared to the original RISC ISA, our extended ASIP achieves approximate 2.69 times performance improvement with only 25.6% more resource required.",

    "abstract": "One of the main drawbacks of orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM) systems is the high peak-to-average power ratio (PAPR) of the transmitted signals, which can cause the introduction of intercarrier interference (ICI) due to the presence of nonlinear power amplifiers (PAs). In this paper, a theoretical analysis of the ICI in nonlinear OFDM systems with polynomial PAs is made. Contrary to other works, this analysis provides an exact description of the nonlinear ICI. Moreover, three receivers for channel estimation and ICI cancellation in OFDM systems with polynomial PAs are proposed, based on the concept of power diversity that consists in retransmitting the information symbols several times with a different transmission power each time. The transmission powers that minimize the sum of the residual mean square errors (MSEs) provided by the proposed receivers are derived in the case of a third-degree polynomial PA. An important advantage of the proposed receivers is that the optimal transmission powers do not depend on the channel and the PA coefficients.",

Platek's thesis (1963), and forms the basis for L. C. F. (1980) and its descendants. In this paper we shall consider (1) the question of whether higher type Y are \"definable\" from lower type Y. We shall show that it is not the case in this context, sharpening a result of ours from [8]. A similar result has been obtained by Warner Damm; (2) the question of the decidability of termination. More precisely, we shall show that it is decidable whether a given term has a normal form. This extends results of Plotkin and Bercovicci. [2]. By similar methods we show that we show that it is decidable whether a term has a head normal form, and whether a term has a finite Bohm tree; (3) the question of the decidability of the word problem. This question was first put to us by Albert Meyer 20 years ago. We shall show that it is in general undecidable whether two lambda Y terms convert. This is done by encoding the behavior of register machines. In addition we shall give a decision procedure for the special case of only Y's of type (0/spl rarr/0)/spl rarr/0.",

    "abstract": "Ancestry informative markers (AIMs) have been proven to contain necessary information for population classification. In this article, round robin symmetrical uncertainty ranking for preliminary AIM screening is proposed. Each single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) is assigned a rank based on its ability to separate two populations from each other. In a multi-population scenario, all possible population pairs are considered and the screened SNP set incorporates top-ranked SNPs from every pair-wise comparison. After the preliminary screening, SNPs are further screened by a wrapper which is embedded with a naive Bayes classifier. A classification model is subsequently constructed from the finally screened SNPs via a naive Bayes classifier. The application of the proposed procedure to the Hap Map data indicates that AIM panels can be found on all chromosomes. Each panel consists of 11 to 24 SNPs and can be used to completely classify the CEU, CHB, JPT and YRI populations. Moreover, all panels are smaller than the AIM panels reported in previous studies.",

    "abstract": "By using the 2-tuple fuzzy linguistic representation model and by proposing the concept of the individual consistency evaluations, this paper develops a 2-tuple linguistic index to measure the consistency degree of linguistic preference relations. Comparing with the existing numerical consistency indexes, the proposed linguistic index not only measures the consistency degree of linguistic preference relations via a linguistic way, but also can reflect the individual difference on consistency degree of linguistic preference relations. Further, this paper proposes an algorithm to improving consistency degree in linguistic preference relations, and the proof of the convergence of this algorithm is also given. The results in this paper provide a theoretic basis for the application of consistent linguistic preference relations in decision making problems.",

    "abstract": "In the domain of hard real-time systems, which language is better: C++ or the Real-Time Specification for Java (RTSJ)? Although standard Java provides a more productive programming environment than C++ due to automatic memory management, that benefit does not apply to RTSJ when using NoHeapRealtimeThread and non-heap memory areas. As a result, RTSJ programmers must manage non-heap memory explicitly. Although that's a common practice in real-time applications, it's also a common source of programmer error, regardless of language. In an ironic role reversal, this paper shows that C++ is able to provide a safer programming environment than RTSJ (or C) for managing memory in a hard-real-time producer/consumer pattern. C++ accomplishes this via a reference-counting pointer. RTSJ (and C) cannot provide an equivalent mechanism because it lacks the necessary language features. Despite other attractive features of RTSJ, the relative simplicity and safety of the C++ programming model for this common pattern suggests that C++ will be a strong competitor to RTSJ in the domain of real-time mission-critical systems.",

    "abstract": "The piezoresistive characteristics of poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene):polystyrene sulfonate (PEDOT:PSS) pressure sensors with inter-digitated (IDE) and cross-point electrode (CPE) structures have been investigated. A small variation of the resistance of the pressure sensors with IDE without bottom indium-tin-oxide (b-ITO) film and with CPE structures was observed owing to the single carrier-conducting pathway. For the IDE pressure sensors with b-ITO, the piezoresistive characteristics at low and high pressure were similar to those of the pressure sensors with IDE without b-ITO and with CPE structures, respectively, leading to increased piezoresistive pressure sensitivity as the PEDOT:PSS film thickness decreased. A maximum sensitivity of more than 42 k\u03a9/Pa was achieved. When the normal pressure was applied, the increased number of conducting points or the reduced distance between the PEDOT oligomers within the PEDOT:PSS film resulted in a decrease of the resistance. The piezoresistive pressure sensors with a single carrier-conducting pathway, i.e., IDE without b-ITO and CPE structures, exhibited a small relaxation time and a superior reversible operation, which can be advantageous for fast piezoresistive response applications.",

    "abstract": "The content industry has been undergoing a tremendous transformation in the last two decades. We focus in this paper on recent changes in the form of social computing. Although the content industry has implemented social computing to a large extent, it has done so from a techno-centric approach in which social features are viewed as complementary rather than integral to content. This approach does not capitalize on users' social behavior in the website and does not answer the content industry's need to elicit payment from consumers. We suggest that both of these objectives can be achieved by acknowledging the fusion between content and community, making the social experience central to the content website's digital business strategy.#R##N##R##N#We use data from Last.fm, a site offering both music consumption and online community features. The basic use of Last.fm is free, and premium services are provided for a fixed monthly subscription fee. Although the premium services on Last.fm are aimed primarily at improving the content consumption experience, we find that willingness to pay for premium services is strongly associated with the level of community participation of the user.#R##N##R##N#Drawing from the literature on levels of participation in online communities, we show that consumers' willingness to pay increases as they climb the so-called \"ladder of participation\" on the website. Moreover, we find that willingness to pay is more strongly linked to community participation than to the volume of content consumption. We control for self-selection bias by using propensity score matching. We extend our results by estimating a hazard model to study the effect of community activity on the time between joining the website and the subscription decision. Our results suggest that firms whose digital business models remain viable in a world of \"freemium\" will be those that take a strategic rather than techno-centric view of social media, that integrate social media into the consumption and purchase experience rather than use it merely as a substitute for offline soft marketing. We provide new evidence of the importance of fusing social computing with content delivery and, in the process, lay a foundation for a broader strategic path for the digital content industry in an age of growing user participation.",

    "abstract": "One of the key questions in credit dependence modelling is the specfication of the copula function linking the marginals of default variables. Copulae functions are important because they allow to decouple statistical inference into two parts: inference of the marginals and inference of the dependence. This is particularly important in the area of credit risk where information on dependence is scant. Whereas the techniques to estimate the parameters of the copula function seem to be fairly well established, the choice of the copula function is still an open problem. We find out by simulation that the t-copula naturally arises from a structural model of credit risk, proposed by Cossin and Schellhorn (2007). If revenues are linked by a Gaussian copula, we demonstrate that the t-copula provides a better fit to simulations than does a Gaussian copula. This is done under various specfications of the marginals and various configurations of the network. Beyond its quantitative importance, this result is qualitatively intriguing. Student's t-copulae induce fatter (joint) tails than Gaussian copulae ceteris paribus. On the other hand observed credit spreads have generally fatter joint tails than the ones implied by the Gaussian distribution. We thus provide a new statistical explanation why (i) credit spreads have fat joint tails, and (ii) financial crises are amplified by network effects.",

    "abstract": "Recently a number of researchers have begun exploring the idea of combining Opposition-Based Learning (OBL) with evolutionary algorithms, reinforcement learning, neural networks, swarm intelligence and simulated annealing. However, an area of research that is still in infancy is the application of the OBL concept to coevolution. Hence, in this chapter, two new opposition-based competitive coevolution algorithms for multiobjective optimization called SPEA2-CE-HOF and SPEA2-CE-KR are discussed. These hybrid algorithms are the combination of Strength Pareto Evolutionary Algorithm 2 (SPEA2) with two types of the competitive fitness strategies, which are the Hall of Fame (HOF) and K-Random Opponents (KR), respectively. The selection of individuals as the opponents in the coevolutionary process strongly implements this opposition-based concept. Scalability tests have been conducted to evaluate and compare both algorithms against the original SPEA2 for seven Deb, Thiele, Laumanns, and Zitzler (DTLZ) test problems with 3 to 5 objectives. The experimental results show clearly that the performance scalability of the opposition-based SPEA2-CE-HOF and SPEA2-CE-KR were significantly better compared to the original non-opposition-based SPEA2 as the number of the objectives becomes higher in terms of the closeness to the true Pareto front, diversity maintenance and the coverage level",

    "abstract": "Multi-core processors naturally exploit thread-level parallelism (TLP). However, extracting instruction-level parallelism (ILP) from individual applications or threads is still a challenge as application mixes in this environment are nonuniform. Thus, multi-core processors should be flexible enough to provide high throughput for uniform parallel applications as well as high performance for more general workloads. Heterogeneous architectures are a first step in this direction, but partitioning remains static and only roughly fits application requirements. This paper proposes the Flexible Heterogeneous Mul-tiCore processor (FMC), the first dynamic heterogeneous multi-core architecture capable of reconfiguring itself to fit application requirements without programmer intervention. The basic building block of this microarchitecture is a scalable, variable-size window microarchitecture that exploits the concept of Execution Locality to provide large-window capabilities. This allows to overcome the memory wall for applications with high memory-level parallelism (MLP). The microarchitecture contains a set of small and fast cache processors that execute high locality code and a network of small in-order memory engines that together exploit low locality code. Single-threaded applications can use the entire network of cores while multi-threaded applications can efficiently share the resources. The sizing of critical structures remains small enough to handle current power envelopes. In single-threaded mode this processor is able to outperform previous state-of-the-art high-performance processor research by 12% on SpecFP. We show how in a quad- threaded/quad-core environment the processor outperforms a statically allocated configuration in both throughput and harmonic mean, two commonly used metrics to evaluate SMTperformance, by around 2-4%. This is achieved while using a very simple sharing algorithm.",

The objective is to create a sparse polyhedral model, only allowing a few interactive user inputs for a given single panoramic image. The study was motivated by the general question whether a single panoramic image projection allows some kind of 3D shape recovery, possibly benefitting from available monocular approaches for standard (say, pinhole-type) camera models.",

    "abstract": "Mammographic density, defined as the proportion of the breast area in a mammogram that contains fibroglandular tissue, is associated with risk of breast cancer. However, measures of mammographic density are subject to variation in the underlying imaging process and in the assessments of observers. Automatic volumetric measures of breast density remove much of this variability, but their association with risk is less well established. We present density measurements produced using area-based visual analogue scales (VAS) and by volumetric assessment software (QuantraTM, Hologic Inc.) in the PROCAS study. The distributions of VAS scores (n = 22 327) and volumetric quantities (n = 11 653) are given, as are their relationships for subjects with results by both (n = 11 096), but these are not directly comparable as one is area-based and the other volumetric. Inter-observer variability in visual area-based estimation is examined by a scatter plot matrix.",

    "abstract": "Major standardization bodies developed and designed systems that should be used in vehicular ad-hoc networks. The Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers (IEEE) in America designed the wireless access in vehicular environments (WAVE) system. The European Telecommunications Standards Institute (ETSI) did come up with the \"ITS-G5\" system. Those Vehicular Ad-hoc Networks (VANETs) are the basis for Intelligent Transportation Systems (ITSs). They aim to efficiently communicate and provide benefits to people, ranging from improved safety to convenience. But different design and architectural choices lead to different network properties, especially security properties that are fundamentally depending on the networks architecture. To be able to compare different security architectures, different proposed approaches need to be discussed. One problem in current research is the missing focus on different approaches for trust establishment in VANETs. Therefore, this paper surveys different security issues and solutions in VANETs and we furthermore categorize these solutions into three basic trust defining architectures: centralized, decentralized and hybrid. These categories represent how trust is build in a system, i.e., in a centralized, decentralized way or even by combining both opposing approaches to a hybrid solution, which aims to inherit the benefits of both worlds. This survey defines those categories and finds that hybrid approaches are underrepresented in current research efforts.",

    "abstract": "To provide elastic cloud services with QoS guarantee, it is essential for data centers to provision Virtual Machine(VM) instances rapidly. Due to bandwidth bottleneck of centralized model, the P2P-like distribution schemes are recently adopted. However, most of them just focus on the transmission speed, but ignore the impact on network band- width, especially for cloud data centers which are connected by Wide Area Network(WAN). In this paper, we propose a bridgehead-employed VM image distribution system(BIDS), which aims to minimize the repet- itive data flows of WAN while speeding up the image distribution. In BIDS, we also design a version based image sharing mechanism, which tries to make a balance between efficiency and management complexity. Besides, we implement a Remote Management Console(RMC). The final evaluation shows that BIDS is of high efficient and low overhead.",

    "abstract": "Power grids vulnerability is a key issue in society. A component failure may trigger cascades of failures across the grid and lead to a large blackout. Within complex network analysis, structural vulnerabilities of power grids have been studied mostly using purely topological approaches, which assumes that flow of power is dictated by shortest paths. However, this fails to capture the real flow characteristics of power grids. We have proposed a flow redistribution mechanism that closely mimics the flow in power grids using the power transfer distribution factor (PTDF). We apply the model to the European high-voltage grid to carry out a comparative study for a number of centrality measures. 'Centrality' gives an indication of the criticality of network components. We also show a brief comparison of the end results with other power grid systems to generalise the result.",

    "abstract": "A systematic design of high-rate full-diversity space-time-frequency (STF) codes is proposed for multiple-input multiple-output frequency-selective block-fading channels. It is shown that the proposed STF codes can achieve rate M t  and full-diversity M t M r M b L, i.e., the product of the number of transmit antennas M t , receive antennas M r , fading blocks M b , and channel taps L. The proposed STF codes are constructed from a layered algebraic design, where each layer of algebraic coded symbols are parsed into different transmit antennas, orthogonal frequency-division multiplexing tones, and fading blocks without rate loss. Simulation results show that the proposed STF codes achieve higher diversity gain in block-fading channels than some typical space-frequency codes",

    "abstract": "Social network worms, such as email worms and facebook worms, pose a critical security threat to the Internet. Modeling their propagation dynamics is essential to predict their potential damages and develop countermeasures. Although several analytical models have been proposed for modeling propagation dynamics of social network worms, there are two critical problems unsolved: temporal dynamics and spatial dependence. First, previous models have not taken into account the different time periods of Internet users checking emails or social messages, namely, temporal dynamics. Second, the problem of spatial dependence results from the improper assumption that the states of neighboring nodes are independent. These two problems seriously affect the accuracy of the previous analytical models. To address these two problems, we propose a novel analytical model. This model implements a spatial-temporal synchronization process, which is able to capture the temporal dynamics. Additionally, we find the essence of spatial dependence is the spreading cycles. By eliminating the effect of these cycles, our model overcomes the computational challenge of spatial dependence and provides a stronger approximation to the propagation dynamics. To evaluate our susceptible-infectious-immunized (SII) model, we conduct both theoretical analysis and extensive simulations. Compared with previous epidemic models and the spatial-temporal model, the experimental results show our SII model achieves a greater accuracy. We also compare our model with the susceptible-infectious-susceptible and susceptible-infectious-recovered models. The results show that our model is more suitable for modeling the propagation of social network worms.",

    "abstract": "This article presents a practical approach to the design of federate architectures for the simulation developers by applying a well-known architectural style, layered architecture, from a developer\u2019s perspective. Adopting layered architecture for an HLA-based simulation (i.e. a federate) provides a clear separation to the following concerns; the user interface (where the user can be a human or an external system such as a GIS server), the simulation logic, and the HLA-specific communication. Thus, layered simulation architecture allows the simulation developers to focus on each concern separately and gives them the freedom to implement each layer in a different programming language, and to encapsulate the repetitive and low-level implementation details of the HLA federate interface specification. Moreover, the article introduces a wrapper for the current HLA runtime infrastructure, and gives an account of the suggested implementation practices through a case study.",

Wavelet coefficients are ranked based on statistics of the Wilcoxon test. The most informative coefficients are assembled to form a feature set that serves as inputs to the tabu-FSAM. Two benchmark datasets, named Ia and Ib, downloaded from the brain-computer interface (BCI) competition II are employed for the experiments. Classification performance is evaluated using accuracy, mutual information, Gini coefficient and F-measure. Widely-used classifiers, including feedforward neural network, support vector machine, k-nearest neighbours, ensemble learning Adaboost and adaptive neuro-fuzzy inference system, are also implemented for comparisons. The proposed tabu-FSAM method considerably dominates the competitive classifiers, and outperforms the best performance on the Ia and Ib datasets reported in the BCI competition II.",

Despite that pressure, it is not clear how that need should be filled, for whom, and by whom. There are many published texts available on which one might base a course, though they are primarily written for English speaking countries. Given the differences in legal practices in different countries, and forensic's dependency on legal procedures, it is not clear how applicable such texts are to Swedish education in the subject. This paper summarises some of the ongoing work at the Department of Computer and Systems Sciences at Stockholm University where we seek to define what the primary elements of a Swedish IT forensics education should be. Interviews conducted with specialists in IT law and IT forensics indicate that there are discrepancies between how representatives from on the one hand the public legal system and on the other private enterprise view the need and the subject matter.",

Reference gene was ef1a. Each of control miRNA levels were arbitrarily set to 1. miR172, miR396a, miR396c and miR4233 may regulate P5CS gene.miR2673 may regulate P5CR gene.miR6461 may regulate ProDH gene.miRNAs regulate proline enrichment of potato under drought stress. Proline is an important osmotic adjusting material greatly accumulated under drought stress and can help plant to adapt to osmotic stress. MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are small, endogenous RNAs that play important regulatory roles in plant development and stress response by negatively affecting gene expression at post-transcriptional level. Three genes of pyrroline-5-carboxylate synthetase (P5CS), pyrroline-5-carboxylate reductase (P5CR) and proline dehydrogenase (ProDH) are regulating proline metabolism. Until now, little is known about miRNAs regulating proline accumulation. In this work, in order to understand whether miRNAs related to mRNAs of enzymes to regulate proline enrichment under drought stress, we used mRNAs of related enzymes as the targets of miRNAs to search miRBase using BLAST and find many query miRNA sequences. After a range of filtering criteria, 11 known miRNAs classified into 6 miRNA families were predicted. The result from qRT-PCR assay showed that 10 out of 11 predicted miRNAs were successfully detected including 9 down-regulated miRNAs and one up-regulated miRNA. Based on expression and functional analysis, we identified miR172, miR396a, miR396c and miR4233 may regulate P5CS gene, and miR2673 and miR6461 may regulate P5CR and ProDH gene, respectively. The findings can help us make a good understanding of the roles of miRNAs in regulation of proline accumulation and provide molecular evidence for involvement process of drought tolerance in potato.",

    "abstract": "Non-destructive phenotyping of earthworms by digital imaging and image analysis is the novel concept being proposed and explored in this paper. Earthworms are very important component of plant soil interaction via rhizosphere. Although a lot of research resources have been applied to phenotying roots by image analysis, there has been practically insignificant work on phenotying earthworms by image analysis. We put together some tailor made image analysis techniques (segmentation, medial axis thinning) along with a mathematical model for earthworms, to compute the volume, surface area and length of earthworms. We developed a novel radius versus length plot to identify the mouth-end, clitellum, and anus-end of earthworms by machine vision. We then compare the results of the phenotyping measurement obtained by our approach to those of the intercept principle. Intercept principle has been commonly used for phenotyping roots. Further more we propose a novel colour signature for blobs obtained by segmenting earthworms for colour analysis of the earthworms. It is expected that the colour information of earthworms can give clues on bioavailability of nutrients in soil or/and for earthworm species recognition. Both by qualitative and quantitative analysis we show that the segmentation and phenotype computation are better than the conventional approach of intercept principle.",

The main reasons include the ease of modelling dependence because of the availability of the correlation matrix and the linearity of the regression coefficients. However, a variety of other useful distributions also involve a correlation matrix: the multivariate Student's t, multivariate power exponential, and multivariate skew Laplace distributions as well as Gaussian copulas with arbitrarily chosen marginal distributions. With modern computing power and software, nonlinear regression functions can be fitted as easily as linear ones. By a number of examples, we show that these distributions, combined with nonlinear regression functions, generally yield an improved fit, as compared to the standard polynomial growth curve model, and can provide different conclusions.",

    "abstract": "A sparse regression modelling technique is developed using a generalised kernel model in which each kernel regressor has its individually tuned position (centre) vector and diagonal covariance matrix. An orthogonal least squares forward selection procedure is employed to append the regressors one by one. After the determination of the model structure, namely the selection of an appropriate number of regressors, the model weight parameters are calculated from the Lagrange dual problem of the original least squares problem. Different from the least squares support vector regression, this regression modelling procedure involves neither reproducing kernel Hilbert space nor Mercer decomposition concepts. As the regressors used are not restricted to be positioned at training input points and each regressor has its own diagonal covariance matrix, a very sparse representation can be obtained with excellent generalisation capability. Experimental results involving two real data sets demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed regression modelling approach.",

    "abstract": "A new technique for stabilizing nonholonomic systems to trajectories is presented. It is well known that such systems cannot be stabilized to a point using smooth static-state feedback. In this note, we suggest the use of control laws for stabilizing a system about a trajectory, instead of a point. Given a nonlinear system and a desired (nominal) feasible trajectory, the note gives an explicit control law which will locally exponentially stabilize the system to the desired trajectory. The theory is applied to several examples, including a car-like robot. >",

First, the S3TC low dynamic range texture compression scheme is extended in order to enable compression of HDR data. Second, we introduce a novel robust algorithm that offers superior image quality. Our algorithm can be efficiently implemented in hardware, and supports textures with a dynamic range of over 10 9 :1. At a fixed rate of 8 bits per pixel, we obtain results virtually indistinguishable from uncompressed HDR textures at 48 bits per pixel.

    "abstract": "Pseudogenes are significant components of eukaryotic genomes, and some have acquired novel regulatory roles. To date, no study has characterized rice pseudogenes systematically or addressed their impact on the structure and function of the rice genome. In this genome-wide study, we have identified 11,956 non-transposon-related rice pseudogenes, most of which are from gene duplications. About 12% of the rice protein-coding genes, half of which are in singleton families, have a pseudogene paralog. Interestingly, we found that 145 of these pseudogenes potentially gave rise to antisense small RNAs after examining ~1.5 million small RNAs from developing rice grains. The majority (>50%) of these antisense RNAs are 24-nucleotides long, a feature often seen in plant repeat-associated small interfering RNAs (siRNAs) produced by RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RDR2) and Dicer-like protein 3 (DCL3), suggesting that some pseudogene-derived siRNAs may be implicated in repressing pseudogene transcription (i.e., cis-acting). Multiple lines of evidence, however, indicate that small RNAs from rice pseudogenes might also function as natural antisense siRNAs either by interacting with the complementary sense RNAs from functional parental genes (38 cases) or by forming double-strand RNAs with transcripts of adjacent paralogous pseudogenes (2 cases) (i.e., trans-acting). Further examinations of five additional small RNA libraries revealed that pseudogene-derived antisense siRNAs could be produced in specific rice developmental stages or physiological growth conditions, suggesting their potentially important roles in normal rice development. In summary, our results show that pseudogenes derived from protein-coding genes are prevalent in the rice genome, and a subset of them are strong candidates for producing small RNAs with novel regulatory roles. Our findings suggest that pseudogenes of exapted functions may be a phenomenon ubiquitous in eukaryotic organisms.",

    "abstract": "The widespread availability of smartphones with wireless communication and geo-positioning capabilities has open new opportunities to services for casual passersby, e.g. the delivery of advertising when they visit a certain area. Typically such messages are delivered to cellular phones, consuming thus part of the energy of these devices. Since these devices are constrained in battery-energy, disseminating messages using little energy represents a challenge for designers of this type of solutions. This paper presents a study based on simulations that intends to identify good strategies to irradiate messages collaboratively, minimizing the energy consumption in the devices involved in the information exchange. The simulation results show that the best irradiation strategy will depend on the number of devices in the area to be irradiated. Moreover, such a strategy will have more influence if the devices are dispersed. These findings should help designers of mobile collaborative applications based on messages irradiation, to identify the best dissemination strategy depending on the current network context.",

The approach is formulated in the frequency domain and is deductive in the sense that it follows the lines of optimal supervised filtering--from which the relationships to be used in the unsupervised situation are derived. This leads to an algorithm where the successive diagonalisations of some cyclic spectral density matrices give rise to unique separating filters. One important result concerns the proposal of solutions to unambiguously recover the exact source permutation at each frequency. A statistical performance analysis of the method is also conducted, with the results suggesting some strategies to increase the robustness of the separation. Examples of successful separation are finally provided on realistic convolutive mixtures, both synthetic and from the real world, where impulse responses of several thousands of coefficients are dealt with.",

This paper investigates whether they can also use languagespecific restrictions on vowel positioning for native speech segmentation. We show that English adults can exploit the fact that typical English words do not end in a lax vowel (e.g. [*di\u02d0t\u028a]) in order to segment unknown words in a nonsense phrase-picture matching task, in contrast to the null results in prior studies using lexical tasks. However, they only used this cue in quiet listening conditions, and not in the presence of background noise.

    "abstract": "Whilst absorptive capacity has been identified as an important contributor to the effective implementation of IT systems, previous studies have failed to explicitly consider the contribution of individual and organizational knowledge processes. Nine case studies of Enterprise Resource Planning ERP implementation were undertaken. The case studies were all undertaken in SMEs in a developing country since this is an important but under researched area for the application of the concept of absorptive capacity. A particular implication of the findings is that firms lacking knowledge of IT implementation cannot simply seek this from external sources but must develop internal organizational knowledge processes if their implementations of IT systems are to be effective. This finding is particularly pertinent to the developing country and SME context of this study, where low levels of experience within the firm and the loss of experienced staff are found to impact on the development of absorptive capacity.",

Such findings do not occur in those with milder symptoms of whiplash, chronic non-traumatic neck pain or healthy controls, suggesting traumatic factors play a role. Muscle degeneration could potentially represent a quantifiable marker of poor recovery, but the temporal constraints of running a T1-weighted sequence and performing the subsequent analysis for muscle fat may be a barrier for clinical translation. The purpose of this preliminary study was to evaluate, quantify and compare MFI for the cervical multifidus muscles with T1-weighted imaging and a more rapid quantitative 3D multi-echo gradient echo (GRE) Dixon based method in healthy subjects.",

    "abstract": "Speaker verification suffers from serious performance degradation if the enrollment and test speech are in different languages. This degradation can be largely attributed to the different distributions of acoustic features in different languages. This paper proposes a linear transform approach which projects speech signals from its own language to another language so that the language mismatch between enrollment and test can be mitigated. The constrained maximum likelihood linear regression (CMLLR) is adopted to conduct the linear transform in the feature domain. The proposed approach has been evaluated on a Chinese-Uyghur cross-lingual speaker verification task. We collected a bilingual speech database CSLT-CUDGT2014 which consists of 113 female speakers who can speak both Standard Chinese and Uyghur. Based on this database and with the proposed linear transform, a relative improvement about 10% in the equal error rate (EER) was achieved.",

The method applied the Parseval's theorem and energy coefficient distribution. The Input-Output cluster method was used to estimate the approximate status of each input features. Then these improve features are feeded into neural network classifier. The proposed method gets 90.27% of accuracy.

The ability to manage and access these collections of digital images is regarded as a key component of next generation medical imaging systems. This paper addresses the problem of retrieving histopathology images from a large collection using an example image as query. The proposed approach automatically annotates the images in the collection, as well as the query images, with high-level semantic concepts. This semantic representation delivers an improved retrieval performance providing more meaningful results. We model the problem of automatic image annotation using kernel methods, resulting in a unified framework that includes: (1) multiple features for image representation, (2) a feature integration and selection mechanism (3) and an automatic semantic image annotation strategy. An extensive experimental evaluation demonstrated the effectiveness of the proposed framework to build meaningful image representations for learning and useful semantic annotations for image retrieval.",

    "abstract": "The literature on gender and social support demonstrates that women are substantially more likely than men to both solicit and receive support \u2014 particularly emotional support \u2014 throughout the life course. In the present paper, we extend work on experiential similarity by examining whether gender affects patterns of support in the face of major negative life events. Previous research has suggested that following status transitions, women\u2019s interactions are affected more strongly than are men\u2019s by similarity of experience (i.e. having experienced the same transition). However, the transitions that have been studied are especially salient to women. Bereavement provides an ideal context in which to further examine these issues, since loss of a close family member is not a gendered event. To investigate the differential effects of experiential similarity on men\u2019s and women\u2019s support, we used longitudinal data on 59 individuals who recently experienced the death of an elderly family member for whom they were caring, and 863 members of their social networks. Multivariate analysis demonstrated that experiential similarity was important in explaining both men\u2019s and women\u2019s patterns of emotional support during bereavement. Further, examination of qualitative data suggested that similarity of bereavement became a focal point for dyads in which the associates had experienced both caregiving and the subsequent loss of the care recipient.",

    "abstract": "This work studies the capacity region of a two-user ergodic interference channel with fading, where only one of the users is subject to interference from the other user, and the channel state information (CSI) is only available at the receivers. A layered erasure model with one-sided interference and with arbitrary fading statistics is studied first, whose capacity region is completely determined as a polygon. Each dominant rate pair can be regarded as the outcome of a trade-off between the rate gain of the interference-free user and the rate loss of the other user due to interference. Using insights from the layered erasure model, inner and outer bounds of the capacity region are provided for the one-sided fading Gaussian interference channels. In particular, the inner bound is achieved by artificially creating layers in the signaling of the interference-free user. The outer bound is developed by characterizing a similar trade-off as in the erasure model by taking a \"layered\" view using the incremental channel approach. Furthermore, the gap between the inner and outer bounds is no more than 12.772 bits per channel use per user, regardless of the signal-to-noise ratios and fading statistics.",

    "abstract": "This paper describes COCO (COnstraint COmpiler), an optimizing compiler for a constraint language embedded within a frame system. The approach to constraint optimization is based on the following observation: when there are multiple inputs to a constraint network the order in which changes are propagated affects overall computational cost. Any uniform algorithm for propagating values through a network that does not take into account data dependencies will produce sub-optimal results. COCO performs a dependency-based partitioning of constraints, allowing it to group constraints to obtain efficiency gains by merging equivalent computations. This helps to produce code that propagates constraints with a minimum of run-time overhead. We will illustrate the design of COCO and its relationship to other work.",

    "abstract": "This paper presents a new buffer sizing methodology for clock meshes. Mesh buffers are usually sized according to the load present in its vicinity. This approach targets at equalizing mesh buffer propagation delays and hence minimizing clock skew. We show that this approach is not well suited when clock signal presents different arrival times at the mesh buffer inputs (i.e. global clock network skew is not zero). Two mesh buffer sizing algorithms are proposed. The first one sizes clock mesh buffers according to the estimated clock arrival time at each mesh buffer input while the second method considers the probability of the clock signal arrival time be within a certain interval. Our experiments show that clock skew can be improved in 8.5% and clock mesh power consumption reduced in 20%.",

    "abstract": "Statistical Static Timing Analysis has received wide attention recently and emerged as a viable technique for manufacturability analysis. To be useful, however, it is important that the error introduced in SSTA be significantly smaller than the manufacturing variations being modeled. Achieving such accuracy requires careful attention to the delay models and to the algorithms applied. In this paper, we propose a new sparse-matrix based framework for accurate path-based SSTA, motivated by the observation that the number of timing paths in practice is sub-quadratic based on a study of industrial circuits and the ISCAS89 benchmarks. Our sparse-matrix based formulation has the following advantages: (a) It places no restrictions on process parameter distributions; (b) It embeds accurate polynomial-based delay model which takes into account slope propagation naturally; (c) It takes advantage of the matrix sparsity and high performance linear algebra for efficient implementation. Our experimental results are very promising.",

    "abstract": "In view of the potential of CSCL for educational innovation, this paper illuminates some aspects resisting the development of quality social interaction in pupil collaboration. A study is reported where pupils worked in small groups in computer-based classroom activity within the framework of a six year-old innovation program in a primary school. A combined ethnographic and discourse analytic model is used to describe group dynamics in four groups of pupils (aged 8-11) involved in tasks of exploratory learning. We analyzed the data taking three distinct perspectives, a personal or insideris perspective, an interactionist perspective and a social norms perspective. The former revealed the pupil to be a person who seemed to perceive the society within which he/she was called upon to act, as a forum in which to claim and defend his/her social role. The interactionist perspective brought forward the issue of role negotiation and its overbearing presence in social exchange in the form of groupthink, role confusion and vagueness. Finally, the group and classroom social norms, which seemed to have emerged as functional within these societies, had a judgmental character.",

The proposed method is based on AF signal extraction using adaptive echo state neural network (ESN). Adaptive ESN estimates a time-varying, nonlinear transfer function between two ECG leads and separates ventricular activity from atrial activity. The method was compared with conventional pre-whitened recursive least squares (RLS) based adaptive filter. Both algorithms were applied to surrogate ECG data with known component of AF signal. Results show that adaptive ESN performs better than conventional pre-whitened RLS filter, especially in lower amplitude AF signals.",

A trie lexicon is constructed from a disease name database containing 21,713 disease name phrases. It expands the search space using a time-synchronous method and applies the beam search strategy to search into a segmentation candidate lattice constructed based on primitive segments. This method restricts the character categories for recognizing each character candidate pattern from the trie lexicon of disease names and preceding paths during path search in the segmentation candidate lattice, and selects an optimal disease name from the disease name database as recognition result. The experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed method, which improves character recognition rate from 94.56% to 99.97% compared with a general-purpose Japanese text recognizer and speeds up recognition time as 4.3 times faster as the general recognizer.",

    "abstract": "The motor system generates time-varying commands to move our limbs and body. Conventional descriptions of motor control and learning rely on dynamical representations of our body's state (forward and inverse models), and control policies that must be integrated forward to generate feedforward time-varying commands; thus these are representations across space, but not time. Here we examine a new approach that directly represents both time-varying commands and the resulting state trajectories with a function; a representation across space and time. Since the output of this function includes time, it necessarily requires more parameters than a typical dynamical model. To avoid the problems of local minima these extra parameters introduce, we exploit recent advances in machine learning to build our function using a stacked autoencoder, or deep network. With initial and target states as inputs, this deep network can be trained to output an accurate temporal profile of the optimal command and state trajectory for a point-to-point reach of a non-linear limb model, even when influenced by varying force fields. In a manner that mirrors motor babble, the network can also teach itself to learn through trial and error. Lastly, we demonstrate how this network can learn to optimize a cost objective. This functional approach to motor control is a sharp departure from the standard dynamical approach, and may offer new insights into the neural implementation of motor control.",

    "abstract": "Current efforts to increase the security of the boot sequence for mobile devices fall into two main categories: (i) secure boot: where each stage in the boot sequence is evaluated, aborting the boot process if a non expected component attempts to be loaded; and (ii) trusted boot: where a log is maintained with the components that have been loaded in the boot process for later audit. The first approach is often criticized for locking down devices, thus reducing users' freedom to choose soft- ware. The second lacks the mechanisms to enforce any form of run-time verification. In this paper, we present the architecture for a two-phase boot verification that addresses these shortcomings. In the first phase, at boot-time the integrity of the bootloader and OS images are veri- fied and logged; in the second phase, at run-time applications can check the boot traces and verify that the running software satisfies their secu- rity requirements. This is a first step towards supporting usage control primitives for running applications. Our approach relies on off-the-shelf secure hardware that is available in a multitude of mobile devices: ARM TrustZone as a Trusted Execution Environment, and Secure Element as a tamper-resistant unit.",

    "abstract": "We present an efficient algorithm for triangle-triangle intersection test in oriented bounding box (OBB)-based collision detection. In testing two OBB leaf nodes (i.e., rectangles), many intermediate computation results can be reused for the intersection test of two triangles they contain. It is considerably easier to detect redundant operations when we work in the local coordinate of the bounding rectangle rather than in the global coordinate of the object. The performance improvement of our algorithm is based on this observation that eliminates redundant computations. Compared with conventional algorithms, we have observed 15-79% improvement in computing time. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach using several experimental results.",

    "abstract": "Based upon a statistically trained speech translation system, in this study, we try to combine distinctive features derived from the two modules: speech recognition and statistical machine translation, in a loglinear model. The translation hypotheses are then rescored and translation performance is improved. The standard translation evaluation metrics, including BLEU, NIST, multiple reference word error rate and its position independent counterpart, were optimized to solve the weights of the features in the log-linear model. The experimental results have shown significant improvement over the baseline IBM model 4 in all automatic translation evaluation metrics. The largest was for BLEU, by 7.9% absolute.",

    "abstract": "Hyper-heuristics can be identified as methodologies that search the space generated by a finite set of low level heuristics for solving search problems. An iterative hyper-heuristic framework can be thought of as requiring a single candidate solution and multiple perturbation low level heuristics. An initially generated complete solution goes through two successive processes heuristic selection and move acceptance until a set of termination criteria is satisfied. A motivating goal of hyper-heuristic research is to create automated techniques that are applicable to a wide range of problems with different characteristics. Some previous studies show that different combinations of heuristic selection and move acceptance as hyper-heuristic components might yield different performances. This study investigates whether learning heuristic selection can improve the performance of a great deluge based hyper-heuristic using an examination timetabling problem as a case study.",

    "abstract": "In this paper, we propose a partial sequence matching based symbolic search (SS) method for the task of language independent query-by-example spoken term detection. One main drawback of conventional SS approach is the high miss rate for long queries. This is due to high variations in symbol representation of query and search audios, especially in language independent scenario. The successful matching of a query with its instances in search audio becomes exponentially more difficult as the query grows longer. To reduce miss rate, we propose a partial matching strategy, in which all partial phone sequences of a query are used to search for query instances. The partial matching is also suitable for real life applications where exact match is usually not necessary and word prefix, suffix, and order should not affect the search result. When applied to the QUESST 2014 task, results show the partial matching of phone sequences is able to reduce miss rate of long queries significantly compared with conventional full matching method. In addition, for the most challenging inexact matching queries (type 3), it also shows clear advantage over DTW-based methods.",

This allows web designers and database developers to publish their databases for web browsers exploring. The proposed approach can be used for both Internet and Intranet application areas. Our approach depends on identifying first databases that are most likely to provide useful results to the raised query, and then search only the identified databases. In our work, we developed and extended an estimation technique to assess the usefulness measure of each database. Our technique has been borrowed from the similar techniques used for information retrieval (IR), mainly for text and document databases; it supports working smoothly with the structured information stored in relational databases. Such a usefulness measure enables nave users to make decisions about databases to search and in what order.",

    "abstract": "Determining the vulnerabilities in power transmission systems requires two distinct steps because most large blackouts have two distinct parts, the triggers/initiating event followed by the cascading failure. Finding the important triggers for large blackouts is the first and standard step. Next, the cascading part of the extreme event (which can be long or short) is critically dependent on the \"state\" of the system, how heavily the lines are loaded, how much generation margin exists, and where the generation exists relative to the load. However, during large cascading events there are some lines whose probability of overloading is higher that the others. Statistical studies of blackouts using the OPA code allow the identification of such lines or groups of line for a given network model, thereby providing a technique for identifying at risk (or critical) clusters. This paper addresses both parts of the vulnerability question.",

    "abstract": "With the rapid advancement of communication technology and mobile devices, many software companies and individual developers have started to develop a variety of mobile applications. However, since the resources individual developers can get are far less than a software company, it is important for individual developers to utilize the free API resources available on the Internet to harvest the benefit of the cloud computing. This research explores the benefits that individual developers can acquire from free APIs and service-oriented computing (SOC) in building desired smartphone applications (apps). Using a VoIP application (app) as an example, the design and implementation of a smartphone app using the proposed approach is described in this article. In addition, by comparing this VoIP app with some other smartphone apps which also provide VoIP services, the advantages and potential value of our approach to integrating social network APIs and SOC concept will be discussed.",

We propose a process algebraic model targeted at the analysis of both such aspects of MANETs. The framework includes a probabilistic process calculus and a suite of analytical techniques based on a probabilistic observational congruence and an interference-sensitive preorder. The observational congruence allows us to verify whether two networks exhibit the same behaviour. The preorder makes it possible to evaluate the interference level of different, behaviourally equivalent, networks. We show our framework at work on the analysis of the well-known Alternating Bit Protocol, contrasting the behavior of the standard implementation of the protocol against an alternative implementation that exploits an ideal interference cancellation scheme for CDMA transmissions.",

    "abstract": "This paper describes complementary software- and hardware-based approaches for handling overlapping register lifetimes that occur in modulo scheduled loops. Modulo scheduling takes the N-instructions in a loop body and constructs an M-stage software pipeline. The length of each stage in the software pipeline is the Initiation Interval (II), which is the rate at which new loop iterations are started. An overlapped lifetime has a live range longer than the II, and as a consequence, the current iteration writes a new value to a register before a previous loop iteration has fin-ished using the old value. Hardware and software solutions for dealing with overlapped lifetimes have been proposed by re-searchers and also implemented in commercial products. These solutions include rotating register files, register queues, modulo variable expansion, and post-scheduling live range splitting. Each of these approaches has drawbacks for embedded systems such as an increase in silicon area, power consumption, and code size.   Our approach, which is an improvement to the current solutions, prevents overlapped lifetimes through a combination of hardware and software techniques. The hardware element of our approach implements a register assignment latency that allows multiple in-flight writes to be pending to the same register. The software element of our approach uses dependence analysis and a constrained modulo scheduling algorithm to prevent overlapped lifetimes. We describe how to use these hardware and software techniques during modulo scheduling. Finally, we present the results of using our approach to compile embedded application code and present results in terms of modulo schedule quality and application performance.",

    "abstract": "Based on the family of three-point derivative free methods without memory of eighth order convergence proposed by D\u017eunic et al. [J. D\u017eunic, M.S. Petkovic, L.D. Petkovic, Three-point methods with and without memory for solving nonlinear equations, Appl. Math. Comput. 218 (2012) 4917\u20134927], we present three methods with memory by suitable variation of a free parameter in each iterative step. This free parameter is calculated using Newton\u2019s interpolatory polynomial of the third degree in two ways and Newton\u2019s interpolatory polynomial of the fourth degree. Consequently, the  R \u00a0 -order of convergence is increased from 8 to               11  +    137      2    \u2248  11.352        ,             6  +  4    2    \u2248  11.657         and 12. The increase in the convergence order is achieved without any additional function evaluations and therefore, the proposed methods possess a very high computational efficiency. Numerical examples are presented and the performance is compared with the existing three-point methods with and without memory of the basic family. Moreover, theoretical order of convergence is verified on the examples.",

    "abstract": "This paper presents new Information Extraction scenarios which are linguistically and structurally more challenging than the traditional MUC scenarios. Traditional views on event structure and template design are not adequate for the more complex scenarios.The focus of this paper is to show the complexity of the scenarios, and propose a way to recover the structure of the event. First we identify two structural factors that contribute to the complexity of scenarios: the scattering of events in text, and inclusion relationships between events. These factors cause difficulty in representing the facts in an unambiguous way. Then we propose a modular, hierarchical representation where the information is split in atomic units represented by templates, and where the inclusion relationships between the units are indicated by links. Lastly, we discuss how we may recover this representation from text, with the help of linguistic cues linking the events.",

    "abstract": "Abstract   In this paper we study the relation between coefficients of a polynomial over finite field    F  q    and the moved elements by the mapping that induces the polynomial. The relation is established by a special system of linear equations. Using this relation we give the lower bound on the number of nonzero coefficients of polynomial that depends on the number  m  of moved elements. Moreover we show that there exist permutation polynomials of special form that achieve this bound when   m  |  q  \u2212  1  . In the other direction, we show that if the number of moved elements is small then there is an recurrence relation among these coefficients. Using these recurrence relations, we improve the lower bound of nonzero coefficients when   m  \u2224  q  \u2212  1   and   m  \u2a7d    q  \u2212  1   2   . As a byproduct, we show that the moved elements must satisfy certain polynomial equations if the mapping induces a polynomial such that there are only two nonzero coefficients out of 2 m  consecutive coefficients. Finally we provide an algorithm to compute the coefficients of the polynomial induced by a given mapping with   O  (   q   3  /  2    )   operations.",

In some scenarios, agents coordinate by voting continuously. When forming such teams, should we focus on the diversity of the team or on the strength of each member? Can a team of diverse (and weak) agents outperform a uniform team of strong agents? We propose a new model to address these questions. Our key contributions include: (i) we show that a diverse team can overcome a uniform team and we give the necessary conditions for it to happen; (ii) we present optimal voting rules for a diverse team; (iii) we perform synthetic experiments that demonstrate that both diversity and strength contribute to the performance of a team; (iv) we show experiments that demonstrate the usefulness of our model in one of the most difficult challenges for Artificial Intelligence: Computer Go.",

    "abstract": "Video streaming is one of the most popular internet services and generates a large percentage of the global network traffic, especially among mobile users. As major video-on-demand (VoD) service providers have seen their bandwidth costs increase, a shift towards peer-to-peer (P2P) architectures has been made. Indeed a number of recent research efforts have focused on offloading media server using P2P architectures, however the battery management of the participating peers has not been sufficiently studied. Ignoring battery constraints in a P2P service that is dominated by mobile users can significantly deteriorate the system's efficiency and lead to low Quality of Experience (QoE) to all users. In this paper, we present a distributed P2P VoD system that successfully utilizes peers' upload bandwidth resources, while preserving their battery. Its components that manage the overlay and the data scheduling are tested under extensive simulations that show promising results.",

This project aims at capturing the similar engagement state patterns for the two learning disabilities. We start by presenting a model of engagement dynamics in spelling learning, which relates input behaviour to learning and explains the dynamics of engagement states. Predictive power of extracted features is increased by incorporating domain knowledge in the pre-processing. The introduced model enables the prediction of focused and receptive states, and of forgetting. In the second part, we extend the model to a more general framework, which takes into account the similarities and dissimilarities of the two studied cases. Finally, we define desirable properties of a general engagement dynamics model, while analysing the reusability of the introduced spelling model.",

    "abstract": "In this paper we propose a game-theoretic model to analyze events similar to the 2009  DARPA Network Challenge , which was organized by the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA) for exploring the roles that the Internet and social networks play in incentivizing wide-area collaborations. The challenge was to form a group that would be the first to find the locations of ten moored weather balloons across the United States. We consider a model in which  N  people (who can form groups) are located in some topology with a fixed coverage volume around each person's geographical location. We consider various topologies where the players can be located such as the Euclidean  d -dimension space and the vertices of a graph. A balloon is placed in the space and a group wins if it is the first one to report the location of the balloon. A larger team has a higher probability of finding the balloon, but we assume that the prize money is divided equally among the team members. Hence there is a competing tension to keep teams as small as possible.    Risk aversion  is the reluctance of a person to accept a bargain with an uncertain payoff rather than another bargain with a more certain, but possibly lower, expected payoff. In our model we consider the  isoelastic  utility function derived from the Arrow-Pratt measure of relative risk aversion. The main aim is to analyze the structures of the groups in Nash equilibria for our model. For the  d -dimensional Euclidean space ( d  \u2265 1) and the class of bounded degree regular graphs we show that in any Nash Equilibrium the  richest group (having maximum expected utility per person) covers a constant fraction of the total volume. The objective of events like the DARPA Network Challenge is to mobilize a large number of people quickly so that they can cover a big fraction of the total area. Our results suggest that this objective can be met under certain conditions.",

    "abstract": "Web applications are a major target of attackers. The increasing complexity of such applications and the subtlety of today's attacks make it very hard for developers to manually secure their web applications. Penetration testing is considered an art, the success of a penetration tester in detecting vulnerabilities mainly depends on his skills. Recently, model-checkers dedicated to security analysis have proved their ability to identify complex attacks on web-based security protocols. However, bridging the gap between an abstract attack trace output by a model-checker and a penetration test on the real web application is still an open issue. We present here a methodology for testing web applications starting from a secure model. First, we mutate the model to introduce specific vulnerabilities present in web applications. Then, a model-checker outputs attack traces that exploit those vulnerabilities. Next, the attack traces are translated into concrete test cases by using a 2-step mapping. Finally, the tests are executed on the real system using an automatic procedure that may request the help of a test expert from time to time. A prototype has been implemented and evaluated on Web Goat, an insecure web application maintained by OWASP. It successfully reproduced Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) and Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) attacks.",

    "abstract": "This paper proposes a torque control method for interior permanent-magnet (IPM) motors operating in a wide speed range requiring high torque/power accuracy and a fast dynamic response. Using the fact that the motor parameters are nonlinear and significantly vary with direct and quadrature current operating points, a new optimal operating plane is generated. This operating plane combines the maximum torque per ampere (MTPA) curve, current limit circle, and maximum torque per volt (MTPV) curve, voltage limitations, and torque calculation under the nonlinear parameter variations. As a result, new feedforward tables are generated, which make full use of measured motor parameters. The new torque and flux regulators built around the feedforward tables provide a fast dynamic response and accurate steady-state torque/power production. The proposed controller was implemented and successfully tested on a 105-kW IPM motor electric drive used in a fuel-cell vehicle program.",

    "abstract": "In this note, we examine the implications of Cahn-Hilliard diffusion on mass conservation when using a phase-field model for simulating two-phase flows. Even though the phase-field variable @f is conserved globally, a drop shrinks spontaneously while @f shifts from its expected values in the bulk phases. Those changes are found to be proportional to the interfacial thickness, and we suggest guidelines for minimizing the loss of mass. Moreover, there exists a critical radius below which drops will eventually disappear. With a properly chosen mobility parameter, however, this process will be much slower than the physics of interest and thus has little ill effect on the simulation.",

We use a preconditioned conjugate gradient algorithm to compute a regularized solution to this linear system given noisy data. Our preconditioner is a Cauchy-like block diagonal approximation to a unitary transformation of the BTTB matrix. We show that the preconditioner has desirable properties when the kernel of the ill-posed problem is smooth: the largest singular values of the preconditioned matrix are clustered around one, the smallest singular values remain small, and the subspaces corresponding to the largest and smallest singular values, respectively, remain unmixed. For a system involving np variables, the preconditioned algorithm costs only O(np (lg n + lg p)) operations per iteration. We demonstrate the effectiveness of the preconditioner on three examples.",

An advantage of the median is that it discards extreme values of the inputs, and hence exhibits a better central tendency than the arithmetic mean. However, the value of the median depends on only one or two central inputs. Our aim is to design median-like aggregation functions whose value depends on several central inputs. Such functions will preserve the stability of the median against extreme values, but will take more inputs into account. A method based on graduation curves is presented.",

    "abstract": "In this paper, a distributed shortest-distance consensus problem is studied under dynamically changing network topologies. Here each agent is assigned to a certain convex region and has information about only its own region. All these regions might not have an intersection. Through local interaction with their neighbors, multiple agents need to collectively converge to a common location that has the shortest total squared distances to these regions. First, a distributed algorithm with a signum function is introduced. A corresponding condition is given to guarantee that all agents finally reach consensus while minimizing the distance performance function. Second, a continuous approximation algorithm is then proposed to remove possible chattering. It is proved that all agents finally converge to a consensus zone where the distance between every two connected agents is no larger than the algorithm parameter. A bound of the difference between the given distance performance function and its minimum is derived, which is proportional to the algorithm parameter. Third, a distributed algorithm is proposed to take into account the case where the agents' regions are time varying. It is shown that the agents reach consensus while minimizing the distance performance function when the regions do not vary abruptly.",

    "abstract": "ABSTRACT#R##N##R##N#Wireless mesh networks (WMNs) are one of the key technologies that will dominate wireless networking in the few years. The main characteristics of WMNs permit network connectivity anywhere anytime with simplicity and low cost. Their capability for self-organization significantly reduces the complexity of network deployment. The draft standard of IEEE P802.11\u2009s\u2122/D4.0 is not considered secure for the routing protocol. In this paper, we propose a secure Hybrid-Wireless-Mesh Protocol using an Elliptic Curve Digital Signature Algorithm (ECDSA-HWMP). We then compare the ECDSA-based HWMP against identity-based encryption (IBE)-based HWMP. This study has been carried out to show the great benefits of the IBE technique in securing HWMP. Through extensive Network Simulator-3 simulations, results have shown that the IBE-HWMP outperforms the ECDSA-HWMP in terms of overhead, throughput, loss ratio and delay. Simulation results show that the use of the IBE-based HWMP provides a greater level of security with light overhead. Copyright \u00a9 2013 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.",

    "abstract": "Research on Dynamic Spectrum Access (DSA) has focused to a large extent on the reliable detection of signals at very low power levels, possibly even under the noise floor. However, many of those channels that are detected to be free are adjacent to used channels, with possibly very large power levels. As a result, the true DSA problem is not only reliable detection of free bands, but also robust operation next to used bands. In this demo we demonstrate an SDR RFIC which is robust against out-of-band interference. This robustness is achieved by improving the linearity of the SDR receiver significantly. The need for robustness is demonstrated in real time by showing the received constellation diagram of an 802.11af-like OFDM signal in the presence of a large out-of-band interferer. The wanted and interfering signal are received simultaneously by two generations of SDR RFIC's, showing both the performance degradation caused by interference from adjacent bands and the improvement enabled by the robust receiver.",

    "abstract": "We consider a computing environment consisting of a network of autonomous, yet cooperating personal computer workstations and shared servers. Computing cycles in such an environment can be shared by creating a pool of compute servers in the network that may be used by the workstations to supplement their computing needs. Some processors may be permanently designated to be the compute servers. In addition, through an advertisement mechanism, any workstation may make itself temporarily available for a specific duration of time to be used as a compute server. In this paper, we present the design and implementation of a scheme for augmenting the UNIX\u00ae operating system with the location independent remote execution capability. This capability allows processes to be offloaded to the compute servers and preserves the execution environment of these processes as if they were still executing locally at the originating machine. Our model provides execution location independence of processes by preserving the process view of the file system, parent-child relationships, process groups, and process signaling across machine boundaries in a transparent way. We also present our scheme that allows processors to advertise themselves as available to some or all nodes in the network and withdraw as a compute server in a distributed manner. The scheme is robust in presence of node failures.",

It consists in identifying features in two or more stereo images that are generated by the same physical feature in the three-dimensional space. This paper presents an evolutionary approach with a multilevel searching strategy for matching edges extracted from two stereo images. The matching problem is turned into an optimization task, which is performed by means of a genetic algorithm with a new encoding scheme. For an effective exploitation of the genetic stereo matching algorithm for real-time obstacle detection, a multilevel searching strategy is proposed to match the edges at different levels by considering their gradient magnitudes.

    "abstract": "This paper defends a cognitive theory of those emotional reactions which motivate and constrain moral judgment. On this theory, moral emotions result from mental faculties specialized for automatically producing feelings of approval or disapproval in response to mental representations of various social situations and actions. These faculties are modules in Fodor's sense, since they are informationally encapsulated, specialized, and contain innate information about social situations. The paper also tries to shed light on which moral modules there are, which of these modules we share with non-human primates, and on the (pre-)history and development of this modular system from pre-humans through gatherer-hunters and on to modern (i.e. arablist) humans. The theory is not, however, meant to explain all moral reasoning. It is plausible that a non-modular intelligence at least sometimes play a role in conscious moral thought. However, even non-modular moral reasoning is initiated and constrained by moral emotions having modular sources.",

It focuses on the SCTP fast retransmit algorithm and demonstrates that the performance in the current retransmission strategy will degrade acutely when the secondary path delay is less than the primary path delay at a certain level. The performance degradation is due to the disordered SACKs and constant congestion window size during the fast retransmit phase. Some modifications aimed at these problems are proposed and evaluated. This paper also identifies that the cause of the performance degradation in SCTP is a result of the single path configuration oriented design of the current fast retransmit algorithm.

We also use a clustering algorithm based on word vectors to enrich the feature information of the data. On this basis, we extend the conventional LDA (Latent Dirichlet allocation) topic model to extract the hot topics in the Micro blog data.

In particular, more and more data mining-based technical trading rules have been developed and used in stock trading systems to assist investors with their smart trading decisions. However, many mined trading rules are of no interest to traders and brokers because they are discovered based on statistical significance without checking traders' interestingness concerns. To this end, this paper proposes in-depth data mining technologies to overcome the disadvantages of current data mining methods. We implement a decision support in-depth trading pattern discovery system with Robust Genetic Algorithms (RGA). The system integrates expert knowledge and considers domain constraints into the trading rule development.

Nowadays, dependable systems which feature graphical user interfaces do not use Widgets libraries, safety of which was ensured. The use of formal methods (the B method in our study) is an interesting solution making it possible to guarantee some of the properties (safety and conformity) of these Widgets. We show that retro-engineering of classical Widgets (Button, Slider) or more elaborate ones (RangeSlider) is possible but error prone and reveals some badly controlled concepts.",

    "abstract": "In this paper, we propose an analytical lens for studying social status production processes across a wide variety of user-generated content UGC platforms. Various streams of research, including those focused on social network analysis in social media, online communities, reputation systems, blogs, and multiplayer games, have discussed social status production online in ways that are diverse and incompatible. Drawing on Bourdieu's theory of fields of cultural production, we introduce the notion of an online field and associated sociological concepts to help explain how diverse types of producers and consumers of content jointly generate unique power relations online. We elaborate on what role external resources and status markers may play in shaping social dynamics in online fields. Using this unifying theory we are able to integrate previous research findings and propose an explanation of social processes behind both the similarity across UGC platforms, which all offer multiple ways of pursuing distinction through content production, as well as the differences across such platforms in terms of which distinctions matter. We elaborate what role platform design choices play in shaping which forms of distinction count and how they are pursued as well as implications these have for status gaining strategies. We conclude the paper by suggesting how our theory can be used in future qualitative and quantitative research studies.",

    "abstract": "The application of Artificial Intelligence techniques in the processes of Software Engineering is achieving good results in those activities that require the use of expert knowledge. Within Software Engineering, the activities related to requirements become a suitable target for these techniques, since a good or bad execution of these tasks has a strong impact in the quality of the final software product. Hence, a tool to support the decision makers during these activities is highly desired. This work presents a three-layer architecture, which provides a seamless integration between Knowledge Engineering and Requirement Engineering. The architecture is instantiated into a CARE (Computer-Aided Engineering Requirement) tool that integrates some Artificial Intelligence techniques: Requisites, a Bayesian network used to validate the specification of the requirements of a project, and metaheuristic techniques (simulated annealing, genetic algorithm and an ant colony system) to the selection of the requirements that have to be included into the final software product.",

    "abstract": "Nearly half of public school teachers leave in their first five years of teaching, and the inadequacy of their preparation is a significant challenge to their success. Teacher attrition results in part from frustration caused by inadequate preparation and lack of a professional development support system. Beginning teachers lack access to exemplars of effective teaching practices. This paper proposes a design framework addressing these problems via a free Internet-based resource for teachers to share videos of their teaching practices and exchange ideas through a supportive online community. This resource would present easily accessible videos of model practices, problem representations, problem solutions. The website would provide a supportive community for beginning teachers; enable them to: form groups centered on common interests, exchange messages, and offer one another feedback on teaching practices; facilitate sharing of classroom materials and best practices; and allow teachers to post profiles of professional and personal information.",

Constraints are used one at a time, no changes are made in the constraint functions (thus the row-action nature of the algorithm) and at each iteration a subproblem is solved consisting of minimization of the objective function subject to one or two linear equations. Convergence of the algorithm is established and the method is compared with other row-action algorithms for several relevant particular cases.",

(J Mol Biol 1981, 145, 215), we have developed the restraint potentials by which the distance and crossing angle of two selected helices can be maintained around target values during molecular dynamics simulations. A series of assessments show that calculated restraint forces are numerically accurate. Since the restraint forces are only exerted on atoms which define the helical principal axes, each helix can rotate along its helical axis, depending on the helix\u2013helix intermolecular interactions. Such a restraint potential enables us to characterize the helix\u2013helix interactions at atomic details by sampling their conformational space around specific distance and crossing angle with (restraint) force-dependent fluctuations. Its efficacy is illustrated by calculating the potential of mean force as a function of helix\u2013helix distance between two transmembrane helical peptides in an implicit membrane model. \u00a9 2006 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

However, the efficient implementation of any application is essential to obtain a good performance, to the point that performance improvements obtained by changes in implementation are usually much bigger than those obtained by algorithmic changes, and they also scale much better. In this paper we will present and apply usual methodologies for performance improvement to evolutionary algorithms, and show which implementation options yield the best results for a certain problem configuration and which ones scale better when features such as population or chromosome size increase.",

This paper conducts a critical literature review and offers an alternative view on the necessity of this KM initiative within an organisation. First, the knowledge map's 'duo-functional' feature (displaying knowledge and also serving as visual pointers to knowledge containers) makes it an effective tool for managing different types of knowledge. Second, the advantages of different types of knowledge maps illustrate the strengths of such a KM tool at different KM dimensions. This paper also summarises two main weaknesses in prior knowledge-mapping projects: (1) lack of effective quality control of knowledge maps; (2) immature perceptions of the knowledge-mapping process. A dynamic knowledge map system is proposed in this paper as a feasible model of applying knowledge maps within organisations.",

    "abstract": "We present a system for semi-automatic creation of bas-relief sculpture. As an artistic medium, relief spans the continuum between 2D drawing or painting and full 3D sculpture. Bas-relief (or low relief) presents the unique challenge of squeezing shapes into a nearly-flat surface while maintaining as much as possible the perception of the full 3D scene. Our solution to this problem adapts methods from the tone-mapping literature, which addresses the similar problem of squeezing a high dynamic range image into the (low) dynamic range available on typical display devices. However, the bas-relief medium imposes its own unique set of requirements, such as maintaining small, fixed-size depth discontinuities. Given a 3D model, camera, and a few parameters describing the relative attenuation of different frequencies in the shape, our system creates a relief that gives the illusion of the 3D shape from a given vantage point while conforming to a greatly compressed height.",

    "abstract": "Real-time imaging systems are expected to perform at a rate set by the operating environment. This places additional temporal constraints on the implementation, and has led to advances in parallel processing and optimization. The constraints are also applied, however, to the analysis and design models of the system, an aspect that has received far less consideration, particularly outside of academia. It is well understood that the earlier an error is discovered the cheaper the fix and this is taken to the extent that, if an error can be found during design or even analysis, the repair can be several orders of magnitude cheaper. It is therefore an economic imperative that the analysis and design models are sufficiently expressive such that the flaws in the model can be discovered before they are implemented, and this applies equally to real-time constraints.The contribution of this paper is to make the case for the use of the Unified Modeling Language, extended with a rigorous formal method, the Q-model, for the specification and design of real-time imaging systems. To illustrate its utility the proposed approach is examined in comparison with a more traditional approach, Structured Analysis and Design, by way of a case study.",

    "abstract": "In this paper we propose a Neural Net-PMRS hybrid for forecasting time-series data. The neural network model uses the traditional MLP architecture and backpropagation method of training. Rather than using the last n lags for prediction, the input to the network is determined by the output of the PMRS (Pattern Modelling and Recognition System). PMRS matches current patterns in the time-series with historic data and generates input for the neural network that consists of both current and historic information. The results of the hybrid model are compared with those of neural networks and PMRS on their own. In general, there is no outright winner on all performance measures, however, the hybrid model is a better choice for certain types of data, or on certain error measures.",

    "abstract": "Predicting the native conformation using computational protein models requires a large number of energy evaluations even with simplified models such as hydrophobic-hydrophilic (HP) models. Clearly, energy evaluations constitute a significant portion of computational time. We hypothesize that given the structured nature of algorithms that search for candidate conformations such as stochastic methods, energy evaluation computations can be cached and reused, thus saving computational time and effort. In this paper, we present a caching approach and apply it to the triangular 2D-HP lattice model. We provide theoretical analysis and prediction of the expected savings from caching as applied this model. We conduct experiments using a sophisticated evolutionary algorithm that contains elements of local search, memetic algorithms, diversity replacement, etc. in order to verify our hypothesis and demonstrate a significant level of savings in computational effort and time that caching can provide.",

    "abstract": "The most accurate approaches to Word Sense Disambiguation (WSD) for biomedical documents are based on supervised learning. However, these require manually labeled training examples which are expensive to create and consequently supervised WSD systems are normally limited to disambiguating a small set of ambiguous terms. An alternative approach is to create labeled training examples automatically and use them as a substitute for manually labeled ones. This paper describes a large scale WSD system based on automatically labeled examples generated using information from the UMLS Metathesaurus. The labeled examples are generated without any use of labeled training data whatsoever and is therefore completely unsupervised (unlike some previous approaches). The system is evaluated on two widely used data sets and found to outperform a state-of-the-art unsupervised approach which also uses information from the UMLS Metathesaurus.",

    "abstract": "Effective utilization of semantic concept detectors for large-scale video search has recently become a topic of intensive studies. One of main challenges is the selection and fusion of appropriate detectors, which considers not only semantics but also the reliability of detectors, observability and diversity of detectors in target video domains. In this paper, we present a novel fusion technique which considers different aspects of detectors for query answering. In addition to utilizing detectors for bridging the semantic gap of user queries and multimedia data, we also address the issue of \"observability gap\" among detectors which could not be directly inferred from semantic reasoning such as using ontology. To facilitate the selection of detectors, we propose the building of two vector spaces: semantic space (SS) and observability space (OS). We categorize the set of detectors selected separately from SS and OS into four types: anchor, bridge, positive and negative concepts. A multi-level fusion strategy is proposed to novelly combine detectors, allowing the enhancement of detector reliability while enabling the observability, semantics and diversity of concepts being utilized for query answering. By experimenting the proposed approach on TRECVID 2005-2007 datasets and queries, we demonstrate the significance of considering observability, reliability and diversity, in addition to the semantics of detectors to queries.",

Furthermore, the switch capability must be respected when assigning devices to sub-networks, which sets constraints for the optimization problem. This is a new problem that has not been modeled before. Then genetic algorithm is proposed to search near-optimal solution for this network partition problem. When designing the fitness function and genetic operators, the communication characteristics of industrial control network, such as the existence of controller and one-way communication of field devices, are considered.

In this paper, we present a new class of LR-aided MIMO detectors (ICSI-LRAD) which is capable of improving the performance of the conventional LRADs by exploiting the second-order-statistics of the channel estimation.

    "abstract": "Let E be a compact set of positive logarithmic capacity in the complex plane and let { P n ( z ) } 1 \u221e be a sequence of asymptotically extremal monic polynomials for E in the sense that lim sup n ? \u221e ? P n ? E 1 / n ? cap ( E ) . The purpose of this note is to provide sufficient geometric conditions on E under which the (full) sequence of normalized counting measures of the zeros of { P n } converges in the weak-star topology to the equilibrium measure on E , as n ? \u221e . Utilizing an argument of Gardiner and Pommerenke dealing with the balayage of measures, we show that this is true, for example, if the interior of the polynomial convex hull of E has a single component and the boundary of this component has an \"inward corner\" (more generally, a \"non-convex singularity\"). This simple fact has thus far not been sufficiently emphasized in the literature. As applications we mention improvements of some known results on the distribution of zeros of some special polynomial sequences.",

    "abstract": "Node centrality and vertex similarity in network graph topology are two of the most fundamental and significant notions for network analysis. Defining meaningful and quantitatively precise measures of them, however, is nontrivial but an important challenge. In this paper, we base our centrality and similarity measures on the idea of influence of a node and exploit the implicit knowledge of influence-based connectivity encoded in the network graph topology. We arrive at a novel influence diffusion model, which builds egocentric influence rings and generates an influence vector for each node. It captures not only the total influence but also its distribution that each node spreads through the network. A Shared-Influence-Neighbor (SIN) similarity defined in this influence space gives rise to a new, meaningful and refined connectivity measure for the closeness of any pair of nodes. Using this influence diffusion model, we propose a novel influence centrality for influence analysis and an Influence-Guided Spherical K-means (IGSK) algorithm for community detection. Our approach not only differentiates the influence ranking in a more detailed manner but also effectively finds communities in both undirected/directed and unweighted/weighted networks. Furthermore, it can be easily adapted to the identification of overlapping communities and individual roles in each community. We demonstrate its superior performance with extensive tests on a set of real-world networks and synthetic benchmarks.",

    "abstract": "We have developed an algorithm capable of enforcing a shape correspondence between two views of the same object in different shape-states. This algorithm, together with several other significant updates, has helped improve the performance of the Integrated Shape and Pose Model (ISPM) described in [1] by a factor of 10. The ISPM utilizes two flexible basis views to integrate the linear combination of views technique with a coupled-view Flexible Shape Model (FSM) [2]. As a proof-of-principle we have evaluated the performance of the improved ISPM in comparison to that of its predecessor [1] and of the conventional FSM [3], via two different databases. The results show that, unlike the FSM, the current ISPM is view-invariant and that, on average, it out-performs the FSM. It also out-performs the initial ISPM described in [1].",

This is our vision for the next generation of the Dataverse Network: an Open Science Platform (OSP). For the first time, researchers would be able to seamlessly access and create primary and derived data from a variety of sources: prior research results, public data sets, harvested online data, physical instruments, private data collections, and even data from other standalone repositories. Researchers could recruit research participants and conduct research directly on the OSP, if desired, using readily available tools. Researchers could create private or shared workspaces to house data, access tools, and computation and could publish data directly on the platform or publish elsewhere with persistent, data citations on the OSP. This manuscript describes the details of an Open Science Platform and its construction. Having an Open Science Platform will especially impact the rate of new scientific discoveries and make scientific findings more credible and accountable.\u0000",

    "abstract": "This paper introduces a evolutionary computation method that applies Bayesian classifiers to optimization problems. This approach is based on Estimation of Distribution Algorithms (EDAs) in which Bayesian or Gaussian networks are applied to the evolution of a population of individuals (i.e. potential solutions to the optimization problem) in order to improve the quality of the individuals of the next generation. Our new approach, called Evolutionary Bayesian Classifier-based Optimization Algorithm (EBCOA), employs Bayesian classifiers instead of Bayesian or Gaussian networks in order to evolve individuals to a fitter population. In brief, EBCOAs are characterized by applying Bayesian classification techniques-usually applied to supervised classification problems-to optimization in continuous domains. We propose and review in this paper different Bayesian classifiers for implementing our EBCOA method, focusing particularly on EBCOAs applying naive Bayes, semi-na\u00a8ive Bayes, and tree augmented na\u00a8ive Bayes classifiers. This work presents a deep study on the behavior of these algorithms with classical optimiztion problems in continuous domains. The different parameters used for tuning the performance of the algorithms are discussed, and a comprehensive overview of their influence is provided. We also present experimental results to compare this new method with other state of the art approaches of the evolutionary computation field for continuous domains such as Evolutionary Strategies (ES) and Estimation of Distribution Algorithms (EDAs).",

    "abstract": "Many telecommunication networks use the open shortest path first (OSPF) protocol for the routing of traffic. In such networks, each router sends the traffic on the shortest paths to the destination, with respect to the link weights assigned. An interesting question is whether or not a set of desired routing patterns can be obtained in an OSPF network by assigning appropriate weights. If not, we wish to find the source of the infeasibility. We study these issues by formulating a mathematical model and investigating its feasibility. A certain structure, called valid cycle, is found to be present in most infeasible instances. This yields new necessary conditions, stronger than those previously known, for the existence of weights yielding a set of given desired shortest path graphs. A valid cycle indicates which parts of the routing patterns are in conflict and can be used for changing the routing patterns to make the problem feasible. A polynomial algorithm for finding valid cycles is presented, the method is illustrated by a numerical example, and computational tests are reported. \u00a9 2008 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

For these computational models we prove lower bounds for testing the solvability of linear Diophantine equations and related problems including the knapsack problem. These bounds are achieved by generalizing and simplifying a lower bound for parallel computation trees due to Yao, introducing a new type of computation trees which models computations of DRAM's, and by generalizing a technique used by Paul and Simon and Klein and Meyer auf der Heide to carry over lower bounds from computation trees to RAM's. Thereby we prove that for many problems,  p  processors cannot speed up a computation by a factor  O ( p ) but only by a factor  O (log( p  + 1)) and in the case of DRAM's whose communication network has degree  c  by a factor  O (log( c  + 1)) only.",

    "abstract": "A new implicit surface fitting method for surface reconstruction from scattered point data is proposed. The method combines an adaptive partition of unity approximation with least-squares RBF fitting and is capable of generating a high quality surface reconstruction. Given a set of points scattered over a smooth surface, first a sparse set of overlapped local approximations is constructed. The partition of unity generated from these local approximants already gives a faithful surface reconstruction. The final reconstruction is obtained by adding compactly supported RBFs. The main feature of the developed approach consists of using various regularization schemes which lead to economical, yet accurate surface reconstruction.",

We have proposed a system level design space exploration methodology [1] for searching an energy efficient error correcting code (ECC). This methodology takes into account the computation and the radio energy in an integrated manner. In this paper we validate this methodology by deploying Imote2 nodes and measuring energy values under different operating modes, e.g., with and without ECC. Experimental results validate the methodology and show that with ECC we can save upto 13% transmitter energy for certain set of conditions. This paper validates experimentally that our methodology is effective in exploration of various node configurations and finding an energy efficient solution.",

    "abstract": "We aim at dimensioning fixed broadband microwave wireless networks under unreliable channel conditions. As the transport capacity of microwave links is prone to variations due to, e.g., weather conditions, such a dimensioning requires special attention. It can be formulated as the determination of the minimum cost bandwidth assignment of the links in the network for which traffic requirements can be met with high probability, while taking into account that transport link capacities vary depending on channel conditions. The proposed optimization model represents a major step forward since we consider dynamic routing. Experimental results show that the resulting solutions can save up to 45% of the bandwidth cost compared to the case where a bandwidth over-provisioning policy is uniformly applied to all links in the network planning. Comparisons with previous work also show that we can solve much larger instances in significantly shorter computing times, with a comparable level of reliability.",

    "abstract": "Although testing is a standard method for improving the quality of software, conventional testing methods often fail to detect faults. Concolic testing attempts to remedy this by automatically generating test cases to explore execution paths in a program under test, helping testers achieve greater coverage of program behavior in a more automated fashion. Concolic testing, however, consumes a significant amount of computing time to explore execution paths, which is an obstacle toward its practical application. To address this limitation, we have developed a scalable distributed concolic testing framework that utilizes large numbers of computing nodes to generate test cases in a scalable manner. In this paper, we present the results of an empirical study that shows that the proposed framework can achieve a several orders-of-magnitude increase in test case generation speed compared to the original concolic approach, and also demonstrates clear potential for scalability.",

    "abstract": "In multiuser multiple-input-single-output (MISO) downlink, linear precoders like channel inversion (CI) and regularized CI (RCI) are more desirable than their nonlinear counterparts due to their reduced complexity. To achieve the full benefits of linear precoding, the availability of perfect channel state information (CSI) at base stations (BSs) is necessary. Since in practice, having access to perfect CSI is not pragmatic, in this paper, we evaluate the performance of CI and RCI under a generalized, imperfect CSI model where the variance of the channel estimation error depends on the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) and thus covers digital and analog feedbacks as two special cases. Then, based on this imperfect CSI model, we quantify the asymptotic mean loss in sum rate and the achievable degrees of freedom (DoFs) by deriving the received signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio (SINR) of each user. For example, it is shown that the achievable DoF is directly related to the SNR exponent of the channel estimation error variance. Also, two asymptotic gaps to capacity for the analog feedback are derived: mean loss in sum rate and power loss. In addition, we propose an adaptive RCI technique by deriving an appropriate regularization parameter as a function of the error variance and without imposing any restrictions on the number of users or antennas. It is shown that in the presence of CSI mismatch, while the comparative improvement of the standard RCI to CI becomes negligible, the adaptive RCI compensates this degraded performance of the standard RCI without introducing any extra computational complexity.",

Disjunction is defined in the feature structure domain, and not at the syntactic level in feature descriptions. This enables us to study properties and specify operations in terms of properties of, or operations on, hypergraphs rather than in syntactic terms. We illustrate the expressive power of this framework by defining a class of disjunctive feature structures with interesting properties (factored normal from or FNF), such as closure under factoring, unfactoring, unification, and generalization. Unification, in particular, has the intuitive appeal of preserving as much as possible the particular factoring of the disjunctive feature structures to be unified. We also show that unification in the FNF class can be extremely efficient in practical applications.",

    "abstract": "Emotion is a cognitive mechanism that directs an agent's thoughts and attention to what is relevant, important, and significant. Such a mechanism is crucial for the design of resource-bounded agents that must operate in highly-dynamic, semi-predictable environments and which need mechanisms for allocating their computational resources efficiently. The aim of this work is to propose a logical analysis of emotions and their influences on an agent's behavior. We focus on four emotion types (viz., hope, fear, joy, and distress) and provide their logical characterizations in a modal logic frame-work. As the intensity of emotion is essential for its influence on an agent's behavior, the logic is devised to represent and reason about graded beliefs, graded goals and intentions. The belief strength and the goal strength determine the intensity of emotions. Emotions trigger different types of coping strategy which are aimed at dealing with emotions either by forming or revising an intention to act in the world, or by changing the agent's interpretation of the situation (by changing beliefs or goals).",

    "abstract": "We propose a set of hypotheses about how the basal ganglia contribute to information processing in cortical networks and how the cortex and basal ganglia interact during learning and behavior. We introduce a computational model on the level of system of networks. We suggest that the basal ganglia control cortical activity by pushing a local cortical network into a new attractor state, thereby selecting certain attractors over others. The ideas of temporal difference learning and convergence of corticostriatal fibers from multiple cortical areas within the striatum are combined in a modular learning system capable of acquiring behavior with sequential structure.",

    "abstract": "A recurring issue in any formal model representing agents\u2019 (changing) informational attitudes is how to account for the fact that the agents are limited in their access to the available inference steps, possible observations and available messages. This may be because the agents are not logically omniscient and so do not have unlimited reasoning ability. But it can also be because the agents are following a predefined protocol that explicitly limits statements available for observation and/or communication. Within the broad literature on epistemic logic, there are a variety of accounts that make precise a notion of an agent\u2019s \u201climited access\u201d (for example, Awareness Logics, Justification Logics, and Inference Logics). This paper interprets the agents\u2019 access set of formulas as a constraint on the agents\u2019 information gathering process limiting which formulas can be observed.",

    "abstract": "Divergence is a discrepancy measure between two objects, such as functions, vectors, matrices, and so forth. In particular, divergences defined on probability distributions are widely employed in probabilistic forecasting. As the dissimilarity measure, the divergence should satisfy some conditions. In this paper, we consider two conditions: The first one is the scale-invariance property and the second is that the divergence is approximated by the sample mean of a loss function. The first requirement is an important feature for dissimilarity measures. The divergence will depend on which system of measurements we used to measure the objects. Scale-invariant divergence is transformed in a consistent way when the system of measurements is changed to the other one. The second requirement is formalized such that the divergence is expressed by using the so-called composite score. We study the relation between composite scores and scale-invariant divergences, and we propose a new class of divergences called H\u00a8older divergence that satisfies two conditions above. We present some theoretical properties of H\u00a8older divergence. We show that H\u00a8older divergence unifies existing divergences from the viewpoint of scale-invariance.",

    "abstract": "With the popularization of smartphones, the needs for indoor location information are rapidly growing these days. Wi-Fi based positioning technique has been widely used to provide positioning information indoors. In particular, fingerprint-based localization is preferred because of its advantage in accuracy. However, the accuracy of localization gradually degrades as the Wi-Fi environment changes. In order to prevent the accuracy degradation, a radio map, which stores the Wi-Fi environment information, should be updated to accommodate the changes. Recalibration is commonly used to update a radio map, but it usually requires considerable time and effort. In this paper, we propose a method that can update the radio map automatically by using fingerprints collected from numerous users. In order to tag the locations of the collected fingerprints more accurately, the data from various sensors such as accelerometer and gyroscope are used. The proposed method also uses optimization algorithms along with a filtering method to remove erroneous data. The evaluation results showed that the accuracy achieved by the method was comparable to that of manual calibration in spite of using user feedback data. This indicates that without recalibration, the fingerprint-based indoor positioning system can keep up its accuracy if it is used by many users.",

    "abstract": "Bio-molecules reach their stable configuration in solvent which is primarily water with a small concentration of salt ions. One approximation of the total free energy of a bio-molecule includes the classical molecular mechanical energy  E   MM   (which is understood as the self intra-molecular energy in vacuum) and the solvation energy  G  sol  which is caused by the change of the environment of the molecule from vacuum to solvent (and hence also known as the molecule-solvent interaction energy). This total free energy is used to model and study the stability of bio-molecules in isolation or in their interactions with drugs. In this paper we present fast  O  ( N  log  N ) multi-level grid based approximation algorithms (where  N  is the number of atoms) for efficiently estimating the compute-intensive terms of  E   MM   and  G  sol . The fast octree-based algorithm for  G  sol  is additionally dependent on an  O  ( N ) size computation of the biomolecular surface and its spatial derivatives (normals). We also provide several examples with timing results, and speed/accuracy tradeoffs, demonstrating the efficiency and scalability of our fast free energy estimation of bio-molecules, potentially with millions of atoms.",

    "abstract": "With reference to social constructivist approaches on citing behavior in the sciences, the hypothesis of acceleration of citing behavior after the millennium was empirically tested for a stratified random sample of exemplary psychology journal articles. The sample consists of 45 English and 45 German articles published in the years 1985 versus 1995 versus 2005 in high impact journals on developmental psychology, psychological diagnosis and assessment, and social psychology. Content analyses of the reference lists refer to the total number of references cited in the articles and the publication years of all references. In addition, the number of self-references, the number of pages, and the number of authors were determined for each article. Results show that there is no acceleration of citing behavior; rather, on the contrary, a significant trend is revealed for an increase in authors\u2019 citing somewhat older references in the newer journal articles. Significant main effects point also at more citations of somewhat older references in the English (vs. German) journal articles as well as in articles on social psychology and psychological diagnosis (vs. on developmental psychology). Complementary analyses show that multiple authorships and the number of pages as well as the total number of references and the number of self-references increase significantly with time. However, percentage of self-references remains quite stable at about 10%. Some methodological and statistical traps in bibliometric testing the starting hypothesis are considered. Thus, the talk that has been circulating among psychology colleagues and students on the potential millennium effects on citing behavior in the sciences (which can, however, become a self-fulfilling prophecy) are not confirmed\u2014at least for psychology journals.",

A paradigm system for monitoring campus power consumptions is constructed and experimented to validate the effectiveness of the proposed PMS. The testing results show that the functions of the proposed PMS comply with the designed objectives. The paradigm PMS also demonstrates good performances in direct load control and warning message transmission. This work possesses novelty for first time integrating ZigBee, DSP, and Web Services technologies to develop PMS, and can be a useful reference for future developments of PMS.",

    "abstract": "This paper presents a novel recognition framework which is based on matching shock graphs of 2D shape outlines, where the distance between two shapes is defined to be the cost of the least action path deforming one shape to another. Three key ideas render the implementation of this framework practical. First, the shape space is partitioned by defining an equivalence class on shapes, where two shapes with the same shock graph topology are considered to be equivalent. Second, the space of deformations is discretized by defining all deformations with the same sequence of shock graph transitions as equivalent. Shock transitions are points along the deformation where the shock graph topology changes. Third, we employ a graph edit distance algorithm that searches in the space of all possible transition sequences and finds the globally optimal sequence in polynomial time. The effectiveness of the proposed technique in the presence of a variety of visual transformations including occlusion, articulation and deformation of parts, shadow and highlights, viewpoint variation, and boundary perturbations is demonstrated. Indexing into two separate databases of roughly 100 shapes results in accuracy for top three matches and for the next three matches.",

    "abstract": "Based on progressively type-II censored samples, constant-partially accelerated life tests (PALTs) when the lifetime of items under use condition follow the two-parameter Burr type-XII (Burr(c,k)) distribution are considered. The likelihood equations of the involved parameters are derived and then reduced to a single nonlinear equation to be solved numerically to obtain the maximum likelihood estimates (MLEs) of the parameters. The observed Fisher information matrix, as well as the asymptotic variance-covariance matrix of the MLEs are derived. Approximate confidence intervals (CIs) for the parameters, based on normal approximation to the asymptotic distribution of MLEs, studentized-t and percentile bootstrap CIs are derived. A Monte Carlo simulation study is carried out to investigate the precision of the MLEs and to compare the performance of the CIs considered. Finally, two examples presented to illustrate our results are followed by conclusions.",

    "abstract": "In recent years, scientists are dealing more and more with data intensive and complex applications. Many scientific workflow systems emerged which adapt technology and methods stemming from the workflow management area and that should support scientists in understanding and working with their complex scenarios. However as these systems often descend from problem solving environments, many of them are missing a well structured conceptual method for process modeling and execution as a foundation. In this publication we present a comprehensive and well structured method for developing and analyzing process based scientific applications. This method is constituted by a process modeling framework, a data integration framework and a model driven approach to build up infrastructures for process modeling and execution.",

    "abstract": "We developed a 1.2 GHz bandwidth spectrometer based on combined complex FFT algorithm for radio astronomy. It resolves the contradiction between wide bandwidth and high speed real-time processing by using the combined complex FFT algorithm. Block-RAMs(BRAMs) in FPGA are saved by parallel processing and module multiplexing, while the computation time also decreases significantly due to symmetry properties of intermediate variables in data processing. Observations at Shanghai Astronomical Observatory for pulsars with the developed spectrometer show that the system works well and meets the requirements of the observation.",

    "abstract": "In the era of service oriented architectures a relevant research problem consists of turning Web applications into Web services using systematic migration approaches. This paper presents the research results that were obtained by adopting a black-box migration approach based on wrapping to migrate functionalities of existing Web applications to Web services. This approach is based on a migration process that relies on black-box reverse engineering techniques for modelling the Web application user interface. The reverse engineering techniques are supported by a toolkit that allows a semi-automatic and effective generation of the wrapper. The software migration platform and the migration case studies that were performed to validate the proposed approach will also be presented in the paper.",

    "abstract": "We will evaluate our techniques and tools on large, real-world systems, comprising tens of millions of lines of code and thousands of defects. The proposed work will attempt to reduce the cost of three specific maintenance tasks: triaging automatically-generated defect reports, automatically synthesizing defect repairs, and automatically identifying out-of-date or incomplete system documentation. We hope to address bottlenecks in each of these three areas and show concrete time and effort savings for each process. The rest of this section describes each maintenance process and our proposed improvements in each case.",

    "abstract": "An increasing number of algorithms for biochemical network inference from experimental data require discrete data as input. For example, dynamic Bayesian network methods and methods that use the framework of finite dynamical systems, such as Boolean networks, all take discrete input. Experimental data, however, are typically continuous and represented by computer floating point numbers. The translation from continuous to discrete data is crucial in preserving the variable dependencies and thus has a significant impact on the performance of the network inference algorithms. We compare the performance of two such algorithms that use discrete data using several different discretization algorithms. One of the inference methods uses a dynamic Bayesian network framework, the other\u2014a time-and state-discrete dynamical system framework. The discretization algorithms are quantile, interval discretization, and a new algorithm introduced in this article, SSD. SSD is especially designed for short time series data and is capable of determining the optimal number of discretization states. The experiments show that both inference methods perform better with SSD than with the other methods. In addition, SSD is demonstrated to preserve the dynamic features of the time series, as well as to be robust to noise in the experimental data. A C++ implementation of SSD is available from the authors at http://polymath.vbi.vt.edu/discretization.",

    "abstract": "An artificial neural network (ANN) is presented for the purpose of estimating passive microwave (PMW) brightness temperatures over snow covered land in North America. The NASA Catchment Land Surface Model (Catchment) is used to define snowpack properties; the Catchment-based ANN is then trained with PMW measurements acquired by the Advanced Microwave Scanning Radiometer (AMSR-E). A comparison of ANN output against AMSR-E measurements not used during training activities as well as a comparison against independent PMW measurements collected during airborne surveys demonstrates the predictive skill of the ANN. When averaged over the study domain for the 9-year study period, computed statistics (relative to AMSR-E measurements not used during training) for multiple frequencies and polarizations yielded a near-zero bias, a root mean squared error less than 10 K, and a time series anomaly correlation coefficient of approximately 0.5. The ANN demonstrates skill during the accumulation phase when the snowpack is relatively dry as well as during the ablation phase when the snowpack is ripe and relatively wet. Overall, the results suggest the ANN could serve as a computationally efficient measurement operator for data assimilation at the continental scale.",

Compared to CPUs, GPUs present different shared memory behavior, and we know of no published formal consistency model for them. To fill this void, we establish a formal state transition model of GPU loads, stores, and fences in the language Murphi, and check properties -- captured in litmus tests that pertain to ordering and visibility properties -- over executions using the Murphi model checker.",

    "abstract": "Many cellular stress-responsive signaling systems exhibit highly dynamic behavior with oscillatory features mediated by delayed negative feedback loops. What remains unclear is whether oscillatory behavior is the basis for a signaling code based on frequency modulation (FM) or whether the negative feedback control modules have evolved to fulfill other functional requirements. Here, we use experimentally calibrated computational models to interrogate the negative feedback loops that regulate the dynamic activity of the transcription factor NF-B. Linear stability analysis of the model shows that oscillatory frequency is a hard-wired feature of the primary negative feedback loop and not a function of the stimulus, thus arguing against an FM signaling code. Instead, our modeling studies suggest that the two feedback loops may be tuned to provide for rapid activation and inactivation capabilities for transient input signals of a wide range of durations; by minimizing late phase oscillations response durations may be fine-tuned in a graded rather than quantized manner. Further, in the presence of molecular noise the dual delayed negative feedback system minimizes stochastic excursions of the output to produce a robust NF-B response.",

Algebraic manipulations reduce the transformed maps to a matrix of polynomials in characteristic roots over the ring spanned by rational functions in the transform variables and the global non-characteristic roots. This Normal---Tangential decomposition for the transformed Dirichlet---Neumann map gives rise to the new notion of a determinant for the intrinsic wave propagator along the boundary.",

    "abstract": "A train backbone network consists of a sequence of nodes arranged in a linear topology. A key step that enables communication in such a network is that of topology discovery (TD), or train inauguration, whereby nodes learn in a distributed fashion the physical topology of the backbone network. While the current standard for train inauguration assumes wired links between adjacent backbone nodes, this work investigates the more challenging scenario in which the nodes communicate wirelessly. The key motivations for this desired switch from wired TD to wireless one are the flexibility and capability for expansion and upgrading of a wireless backbone. The implementation of TD over wireless channels is made difficult by the broadcast nature of the wireless medium, as well as by fading and interference. A novel TD protocol is proposed, which overcomes these issues and requires relatively minor changes to the wired standard. The protocol is shown via analysis and numerical results to be robust to the impairments caused by the wireless channel, including interference from other trains.",

    "abstract": "Novelty detection is a crucial task in the development of autonomous vision systems. It aims at detecting if samples do not conform with the learnt models. In this paper, we consider the problem of detecting novelty in object recognition problems in which the set of object classes are grouped to form a semantic hierarchy. We follow the idea that, within a semantic hierarchy, novel samples can be defined as samples whose categorization at a specific level contrasts with the categorization at a more general level. This measure indicates if a sample is novel and, in that case, if it is likely to belong to a novel broad category or to a novel sub-category. We present an evaluation of this approach on two hierarchical subsets of the Caltech256 objects dataset and on the SUN scenes dataset, with different classification schemes. We obtain an improvement over Weinshall et al. and show that it is possible to bypass their normalisation heuristic. We demonstrate that this approach achieves good novelty detection rates as far as the conceptual taxonomy is congruent with the visual hierarchy, but tends to fail if this assumption is not satisfied.",

    "abstract": "We describe the construction and performance of `brain-based devices? (BBDs), physical devices whose behaviour is controlled by simulated nervous systems modelled on vertebrate neuroanatomy and neurophysiology, that carry out perceptual categorization and selective conditioning to visual and textural stimuli. BBDs take input from the environment through on-board sensors including cameras, microphones and artificial whiskers, and take action based on experiential learning. BBDs have a large-scale neural simulation, a phenotype, a body plan, and the means to learn through autonomous exploration. Key neural mechanisms in the present BBDs include synaptic plasticity, reward or value systems, reentrant connectivity, the dynamic synchronization of neuronal activity, and neuronal units with spatiotemporal response properties. With our BBDs, as with animals, it is the interaction of these neural mechanisms with the sensorimotor correlations generated by active sensing and self motion that is responsible for adaptive behaviour. BBDs permit analysis of activity at all levels of the nervous system during behaviour, and as such they provide a rich source of heuristics for generating hypotheses regarding brain function. Moreover, by taking inspiration from systems neuroscience, BBDs provide a novel architecture for the design of neuromorphic systems.",

    "abstract": "This paper presents a new method for selecting valuable training data for support vector machines (SVM) from large, noisy sets using a genetic algorithm (GA). SVM training data selection is a known, however not extensively investigated problem. The existing methods rely mainly on analyzing the geometric properties of the data or adapt a randomized selection, and to the best of our knowledge, GA-based approaches have not been applied for this purpose yet. Our work was inspired by the problems encountered when using SVM for skin segmentation. Due to a very large set size, the existing methods are too time-consuming, and random selection is not effective because of the set noisiness. In the work reported here we demonstrate how a GA can be used to optimize the training set, and we present extensive experimental results which confirm that the new method is highly effective for real-world data.",

The approach is to construct a statistical modelof appearance which can encode the training images as compactly as possible(a Minimum Description Length framework).  Correspondences are defined bypiece-wise linear interpolation between a set of control points defined oneach image.  Given such points a model can be constructed, which can approximateevery image in the set.  The description length encodes the cost of the model,the parameters and most importantly, the residuals not explained by the model.By modifying the positions of the control points we can optimise the descriptionlength, leading to good correspondence.  We describe the algorithm in detailand give examples of its application to MR brain images and to faces.  We alsodescribe experiments which use a recently-introduced specificity measureto evaluate the performance of different components of the algorithm.",

    "abstract": "We present Spectral Registration with Multilayer Resampling (SRMR) as a 6 Degrees Of Freedom (DOF) registration method for noisy 3D data with partial overlap. The algorithm is based on decoupling 3D rotation from 3D translation by a corresponding resampling process of the spectral magnitude of a 3D Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) calculation on discretized 3D range data. The registration of all 6DOF is then subsequently carried out with spectral registrations using Phase Only Matched Filtering (POMF). There are two main aspects for the fast and robust registration of Euler angles from spherical information in SRMR. First of all, there is the permanent use of phase matching. Second, based on the FFT on a discrete Cartesian grid, not only one spherical layer but also a complete stack of layers are processed in one step. Experiments are presented with challenging datasets with respect to interference and overlap. The results include the fast and robust registration of artificially transformed data for ground-truth comparison, scans from the Stanford Bunny dataset, high end 3D laser range finder (LRF) scans of a city center, and range data from a low-cost actuated LRF in a disaster response scenario.",

The first component consists of a novel semi-supervised possibilistic clustering and feature weighting algorithm based on robust modeling of the generalized Dirichlet (GD) finite mixture. This algorithm is used to group image regions into prototypical region clusters that summarize the training data and can be used as the basis of annotating new test images. The constraints consist of pairs of image regions that should not be included in the same cluster. These constraints are deduced from the irrelevance of all concepts annotating the training images to help in guiding the clustering process. The second component of our system consists of a probabilistic model that relies on the possibilistic membership degrees, generated by the clustering algorithm, to annotate unlabeled images. The proposed system was implemented and tested on a data set that include thousands of images using four-fold cross validation.",

Thirteen AD patients and 13 age-matched controls participated in the experiment of two visual search tasks, one was a pop-out task, the other was a conjunction task. The fMRI data were collected on a 1-5T MRI system and analyzed by SPM99. Both groups revealed almost the same networks engaged in both tasks, including the superior parietal lobule (SPL), frontal and occipito-temporal cortical regions (OTC), primary visual cortex and some subcortical structures. AD patients have a particular impairment in the conjunction task. The most pronounced differences were more activity in the SPL in controls and more activity in the OTC in AD patients. These results imply that the mechanisms controlling spatial shifts of attention axe impaired in AD patients.",

    "abstract": "Telecommunication applications are distinguished by their stringent requirements for availability and completion times. A highly available, low-latency, distributed data store is therefore a critical component of cloud-based realizations of telecommunication services. We present a systematic experimental evaluation of state-of-the-art database systems as components of telecommunication applications. We show that while their average latencies are well within the required time scales, the distribution of latencies exhibits a long tail of unacceptably large outliers which may significantly impair meeting the performance requirements of telecommunication applications. To address the observed phenomenon of high latency outliers, we present a new solution that is implemented in a Bell Labs system code named Flurry. Flurry is based on using the first response from a replica rather than waiting for all or a quorum of responses from replicas. To handle incorrect responses arising from message losses, Flurry uses a novel checking algorithm based on vector clocks to determine the correctness of a replica's response. We present experimental evaluation results which show that Flurry significantly reduces both the average response time and the probability of unacceptable response times to values that would allow meeting the availability and completion time thresholds required for telecommunication services. \u00a9 2012 Alcatel-Lucent.",

    "abstract": "We use a method that captures the intrinsic metrics of variables in a cross-tabulation to analyze data on the association between referee recommendations and editorial decisions at two scholarly journals. The method enables researchers to (1) determine the number of latent dimensions needed to account for this association, and (2) estimate scale values for both the referee-recommendation and the editorial-decision categories. We show that one latent dimension is sufficient to account for the association at each journal, and that both referee-recommendation categories and editorial-decision categories have scale values on the dimension that are consistent with their ostensible meanings.",

    "abstract": "We present an iterative chip-level time domain equalizer (TEQ) for direct sequence code division multiple access (DS-CDMA) downlink with code multiplexed training symbols. For heavily loaded system, the multiple access interference (MAI) may be so severe that the pilot information offered by the training symbols are badly distorted. And this results in poorly converged equalizer coefficients. The proposed approach does not only utilize the training symbols, put also all the active and passive spreading codewords for TEQ adaptation. At each iteration, improved estimates of the transmitted data symbols are acquired and together with the pilot symbols, they are used to train the TEQ weights. Consequently, the signal-to-interference and noise (SINR) ratios of the effective training symbols is increased. Simulation results show that the proposed equalizer can achieve better bit-error rate performances than the generalized minimum mean squared error equalizer.",

An important objective is to achieve an automatic computation which is effective for a wide range of instances. Singular or near singular integrand behavior is handled via an adaptive partitioning of the domain, implemented in an iterated/repeated multivariate integration method. Integrand singularities possibly introduced via infrared (IR) divergence at the boundaries of the integration domain are addressed using a version of the  Dqags  algorithm from the integration package Quadpack, which uses an adaptive strategy combined with extrapolation. The latter is justified for a large class of problems by the underlying asymptotic expansions of the integration error. For IR divergent problems, an extrapolation scheme is presented based on dimensional regularization.",

It takes advantage of leading zeros and symmetry in the table entries to reduce the table sizes. By increasing the number of tables and the number of operands in the multi-operand addition, the amount of memory is significantly reduced. This method provides a closed form solution for the table entries and can be applied to a variety of elementary functions. Compared to conventional table lookups, it requires two to three orders of magnitude less memory.

Unlike existing IP mobility support protocols, DMM protocols being considered at the IETF aim at distributing mobile Internet traffic in an optimal way while not relying on centrally deployed mobility anchors. In this article, we first discuss motivations and requirements of DMM. We then present two different possible approaches: host-based and network-based DMM approaches.

Despite the recent developments in the domain there is still a lack of transparency and consistent definition and integration of the activities in requirement engineering (RE). There is also a lack of structured methods for capturing relevant enterprise knowledge and deploying it in support of decision making for requirement specification. This paper reports on the knowledge acquisition and sharing for requirement engineering (KARE) approach for requirement specification of one-of-a-kind complex systems. The approach provides a generic view of key RE processes clustered into three groups of activities: requirement elicitation, analysis and negotiation. The process is supported by a set of knowledge functions aimed at facilitating the requirement engineers in matching customer requirements to product characteristics. The reported research has been developed as part of the ESPRIT collaborative project KARE funded by the European Commission.",

We propose a wavelet based technique that exploits T/O sharing across a query batch to evaluate the set of queries progressively and efficiently. The challenge is that now controlling the structure of errors across query results becomes more critical than minimizing error per individual query. Consequently, we define a class of structural error penalty functions and show how they are controlled by our technique Experiments demonstrate that our technique is efficient as an exact algorithm, and the progressive estimates are accurate, even after less than one I/O per query.",

    "abstract": "When using models and simulations in the design and reconfiguration of manufacturing systems, it is difficult to gage the fidelity of the model, especially if the system being modeled doesn't yet exist. The model cannot typically be validated until the system is in place. We propose the concept of Hybrid Process Simulation (HPS), an extension of traditional Hardware-in-Loop (HIL) technology, as a bridge between pure simulation and the final physical system. In this paper, we present a framework for swapping a virtual device with its real counterpart. The virtual model is developed using simulation software obtained from the vendor of the actual device, so that the model offers the same functionality as the actual device. Using the vendor simulation software, we were able to demonstrate the modularity of HPS, since the virtual and actual device can be more easily swapped with minimal changes to the rest of the existing system. The framework is presented as a proof-of-concept for HPS applications in the design and reconfiguration of a manufacturing line. A case study describing the implementation of the hybrid process simulation using a virtual and real robot on the Reconfigurable Factory Testbed at the University of Michigan is presented.",

Since a mobile phone has small screen, low computing power, small storage capacity etc, the present paper proposes an ECC-based PKI that overcomes all the limitations for the mobile phones as mentioned above. For this, we introduce a Mobile Home Agent (MHA) and Registration Authority (RA) that minimize the major work/processing loads of mobile phone and Certificate Authority (CA), respectively. In addition, the use of ECC reduces the computation cost, message size and transmission overhead over RSA significantly. The security analysis of the proposed PKI against relevant attacks and the comparisons with existing schemes shows overall improved performance.",

    "abstract": "A group of identical mobile agents moving asynchronously among the nodes of an anonymous network have to gather together in a single node of the graph. This problem known as the (asynchronous anonymous multi-agent) rendezvous problem has been studied extensively but only for networks that are safe or fault-free. In this paper, we consider the case when some of the edges in the network are dangerous or faulty such that any agent travelling along one of these edges would be destroyed. The objective is to minimize the number of agents that are destroyed and achieve rendezvous of all the surviving agents. We determine under what conditions this is possible and present algorithms for achieving rendezvous in such cases. Our algorithms are for arbitrary networks with an arbitrary number of dangerous channels; thus our model is a generalization of the case where all the dangerous channels lead to single node, called the Black Hole. We do not assume prior knowledge of the network topology; In fact, we show that knowledge of only a \"tight\" bound on the network size is sufficient for solving the problem, whenever it is solvable.",

    "abstract": "Implementations of lazy evaluation for nonstrict functional languages usually involve the notion of a delayed representation of the value of an expression, which we call athunk. We present several techniques for implementing thunks and formalize a class of optimizations that reduce both the space and time overhead of these techniques. The optimizations depend on a compile-time inferencing strategy calledpath analysis, a generalization of strictness analysis that uncovers order-of-evaluation information. Although the techniques in this paper are focused on the compilation of a nonstrict functional language for a conventional architecture, they are directly applicable to most of the virtual machines commonly used for implementing such languages. The same techniques also apply to other forms of delayed evaluation such asfutures andpromises.",

    "abstract": "This paper presents new technology that accelerates system verification. Traditional methods for verifying functional designs are based on logic simulation, which becomes more time-consuming as design complexity increases. To accelerate functional simulation, hardware acceleration is used to offload calculation-intensive tasks from the software simulator. Hardware accelerated simulation dramatically reduces the simulation time. However, the communication overhead between the software simulator and hardware accelerator is becoming a new critical bottleneck. We reduce the communication overhead by exploiting burst data transfer and parallelism, which are obtained by splitting testbench and moving a part of testbench into hardware accelerator. Our experiments demonstrated that the proposed method reduces the communication overhead by a factor of about 40 compared to conventional hardware accelerated simulation while maintaining the cycle accuracy and compatibility with the original testbench.",

This paper describes a mobile aware bootup framework by isolating the dependencies of the execution sequence among the processes, and by simplifying the existing init scheme to accelerate the boot time of the mobile device. From our experiment, our proposed approaches reduce the bootup time of the mobile device by about 50%.",

    "abstract": "The use of autonomous, mobile professional service robots in diverse workplaces is expected to grow substantially over the next decade. These robots often will work side by side with people, collaborating with employees on tasks. Some roboticists have argued that, in these cases, people will collaborate more naturally and easily with humanoid robots as compared with machine-like robots. It is also speculated that people will rely on and share responsibility more readily with robots that are in a position of authority. This study sought to clarify the effects of robot appearance and relative status on human-robot collaboration by investigating the extent to which people relied on and ceded responsibility to a robot coworker.#R##N##R##N#In this study, a 3 \u00d7 3 experiment was conducted with human likeness (human, human-like robot, and machine-like robot) and status (subordinate, peer, and supervisor) as dimensions. As far as we know, this study is one of the first experiments examining how people respond to robotic coworkers. As such, this study attempts to design a robust and transferable sorting and assembly task that capitalizes on the types of tasks robots are expected to do and is embedded in a realistic scenario in which the participant and confederate are interdependent. The results show that participants retained more responsibility for the successful completion of the task when working with a machine-like as compared with a humanoid robot, especially when the machine-like robot was subordinate. These findings suggest that humanoid robots may be appropriate for settings in which people have to delegate responsibility to these robots or when the task is too demanding for people to do, and when complacency is not a major concern. Machine-like robots, however, may be more appropriate when robots are expected to be unreliable, are less well-equipped for the task than people are, or in other situations in which personal responsibility should be emphasized.",

    "abstract": "We are concerned with the issues on designing adaptive trading agents to learn bidding strategies in electronic market places. The synchronous double auction is used as a simulation testbed. We implemented agents with neural-network-based reinforcement learning called Q-learning agents (QLA) to learn bidding strategies in the double auctions. In order to compare the performances of QLAs in the electronic market places, we also implemented many kinds of non-adaptive trading agents such as simple random bidding agents (SRBA), gradient-based greedy agent (GBGA), and truth telling agent (TTA). Instead of learning to model other trading agents that is computational intractable, we designed learning agents to model the market environment as a whole instead. Our experimental results showed that in terms of global market efficiency, QLAs could outperform TTAs and GBGAs but could not outperform SRBAs in the market of homogeneous type of agents. In terms of individual performance, QLAs could outperform all three non-adaptive trading agents when the opponents they are dealing with in the market place are a purely homogeneous type of non-adaptive trading agents. However, QLAs could only outperform TTAs and GBGAs and could not outperform SRBAs in the market of heterogeneous types of agents.",

The rule induction is based on creating agents within the main modeling processes. This method is suitable for qualitative information and also takes into account user preferences. Furthermore, we designed an incremental architecture for addressing dynamic database problems of rough set-based rule induction, making it unnecessary to re-compute the whole dataset when the database is updated. As a result, huge degrees of computation time and memory space are saved when executing IRSRIA. Finally, we apply our method to a case study of a cell phone purchase. The results show the practical viability and efficiency of this method, and thus this paper forms the basis for solving many other similar problems that occur in the service industry.",

Compression methods which are capable of delivering higher reconstruction quality for the important parts are attractive in this situation. For medical images, only a small portion of the image might be diagnostically useful, but the cost of a wrong interpretation is high. Algorithms which deliver lossless compression within the regions of interest, and lossy compression elsewhere in the image, might be the key to providing efficient and accurate image coding to the medical community. We present and compare several new algorithms for lossless region-of-interest (ROI) compression. One is based on lossless coding with the S-transform, and two are based on lossy wavelet zerotree coding together with either pixel-domain or transform-domain coding of the regional residual. We survey previous methods for region-based coding of medical images.",

    "abstract": "In digital forensic, evidence images are stored on the disk by a forensic tool. However, the stored images can be damaged due to unexpected internal and external electromagnetic effects. Existing forensic tools only provide integrity and authenticity of the evidence images by utilizing legacy cryptographic methods, i.e., applying hash values and digital signatures. Accordingly, such integrity and authenticity applied to those evidence images can be easily corrupted when the disk is damaged. In this paper, we focus on such limitations of the existing forensic tools and introduce a new scheme that can recover and protect the evidence images on the disk. Specifically, evidence images are divided into blocks; linkage relations between those blocks are formed; and a meta-block is applied to restore the damaged blocks. Blocks in the damaged areas detected using CRC information are subject to a multi-dimensional block operation for recovery of damaged blocks and protection for evidence images.",

    "abstract": "We demonstrate how adversaries with large computing resources can break quantum key distribution (QKD) protocols which employ a particular message authentication code suggested previously. This authentication code, featuring low key consumption, is not information-theoretically secure (ITS) since for each message the eavesdropper has intercepted she is able to send a different message from a set of messages that she can calculate by finding collisions of a cryptographic hash function. However, when this authentication code was introduced, it was shown to prevent straightforward man-in-the-middle (MITM) attacks against QKD protocols. In this paper, we prove that the set of messages that collide with any given message under this authentication code contains with high probability a message that has small Hamming distance to any other given message. Based on this fact, we present extended MITM attacks against different versions of BB84 QKD protocols using the addressed authentication code; for three protocols, we describe every single action taken by the adversary. For all protocols, the adversary can obtain complete knowledge of the key, and for most protocols her success probability in doing so approaches unity. Since the attacks work against all authentication methods which allow to calculate colliding messages, the underlying building blocks of the presented attacks expose the potential pitfalls arising as a consequence of non-ITS authentication in QKD post-processing. We propose countermeasures, increasing the eavesdroppers demand for computational power, and also prove necessary and sufficient conditions for upgrading the discussed authentication code to the ITS level.",

Specifying FDs for XML documents is more difficult because unlike relational databases, XML documents do not have uniform structures. This paper introduces XML Template Functional Dependencies (XTFDs), which are able to specify FDs for XML documents. This paper also presents a necessary and sufficient condition for an XTFD to cause data redundancy in XML documents. Further, we propose Attribute Rule and Text String Rule as two procedures that can be repeatedly applied to remove redundancy caused by XTFDs. In addition, we prove that if an XML document has data redundancy with respect to an FD specified by using the tree tuple approach, it would have data redundancy with respect to an XTFD and show by example that XTFDs can specify some FDs for XML documents that the tree tuple approach cannot.",

    "abstract": "The resource allocation problem for the downlink of orthogonal frequency-division multiple access OFDMA wireless multicast systems is investigated. It is assumed that the base station consists of multiple antennas in a distributed antenna system DAS, whereas each user is equipped with a single antenna. The multicasting technology is able to support several groups of users with flexible quality of service QoS requirements. The general mathematical formulation is provided, but achieving the optimal solution has a high computational cost. In our approach, the allocation unit is not the subcarrier, as in conventional OFDMA systems, but a set of contiguous subcarriers, which is called 'chunk'. For practical implementation, a suboptimal but efficient algorithm is proposed in order to maximize the sum of the maximum attainable data rates of multicast groups of users, subject to total available power and proportional maximum attainable data rate constraints among multicast groups of users. Simulation and complexity analyses are provided to support the benefits of chunk-based resource allocation to multicast OFDMA DASs, supporting that the proposed algorithm can be applied to latest-generation wireless systems that provide QoS guarantees.

The position and orientation of the robot are systematically adjusted and the possibility of finding a valid foothold for the next swing is maximized, which makes the robot have more chances to overcome the rough terrains. In addition, a foothold search algorithm that provides the valid foothold while maintaining a high traversability of the robot, is investigated and a gait selection algorithm is developed to help the robot avoid deadlock situations. To explain the algorithms, new concepts such as reachable area, stable area, potential search direction, and complementary kinematic margin are introduced, and the effectiveness of the algorithms is validated via simulations and experiments.",

A low complexity detection window, synchronization state machine, and two-stage detection are used to lower the computational complexity. The positions of the detection window and received samples are recorded, and the position and length of the detection window are controlled by the state machine. The positions are compared to decide if the received sample is useful for synchronization signal detection. Such techniques avoid unnecessary computations especially when implementing a receiver on a software defined radio (SDR) platform with general-purpose processors. We analyze the computational complexity of the proposed method and evaluate its performance based on simulations and using a Universal Software Radio Peripheral (USRP)-based SDR platform. The evaluation shows that the proposed method provides reliable and real-time synchronization signals on the considered SDR platform.",

Breakthrough solutions in combinatorial optimization are the most impressive area of success but, in order to solve combinatorial optimization problems, problems related to the reliability of biological operators, stable DNA expressions, processing speed, expandability and the universality of evaluation criteria must be solved. This study implements a DNA sequence generation system that minimizes errors using DNA coding based on evolutionary models and performs simulation using biological experiment operators. The usefulness of this system is evaluated by applying the Hamiltonian Path Problem (HPP) in the form of a genetic algorithm.

An efficient scan-shift power reduction scheme based on scan chain partitioning and test vector reordering is presented in this paper. After partitioning the scan chains into several segments equally, a heuristic ant colony optimization (ACO) algorithm is introduced to reorder the test vectors to minimize the clashes between the previous test response and current test vector, which leads to scan-shift power reduction further. Experimental results show that the proposal can achieve 3.48% scan-shift power reduction on average with the help of ACO test vectors reordering after scan partitioning. Furthermore, the proposed scan-shift power reduction technique can be acceptable for any scan-based testing architecture without affecting test application time, test fault coverage, performance and/or routing cost of the CUT.",

Next, this paper indicates a possibility of detecting a sign of service quality deterioration by monitoring the power consumption pattern of ICT devices, on condition that smart grids are widely introduced and power sensors are attached to ICT devices.

Such a period is often critical for timely data processing. Hence, we call it a memory-performance critical section. Unfortunately, in multicore architecture, non-real-time applications on different cores may also demand high memory bandwidth at the same time, which can substantially increase the time spent on the memory performance critical sections. #R##N#In this paper, we present BWLOCK, user-level APIs and a memory bandwidth control mechanism that can protect such memory performance critical sections of soft real-time applications. BWLOCK provides simple lock like APIs to declare memory-performance critical sections. If an application enters a memory-performance critical section, the memory bandwidth control system then dynamically limit other cores' memory access rates to protect memory performance of the application until the critical section finishes. #R##N#From case studies with real-world soft real-time applications, we found (1) such memory-performance critical sections do exist and are often easy to identify; and (2) applying BWLOCK for memory critical sections significantly improve performance of the soft real-time applications at a small or no cost in throughput of non real-time applications.",

The BEDA stresses the balance between global exploration and local exploitation. In the framework of estimation of distribution algorithm, two sub-populations are used to adjust the machine assignment and operation sequence respectively with a splitting criterion and a combination criterion. At the initialization stage, multiple strategies are utilized in a combination way to generate the initial solutions. At the global exploration phase, a probability model is built with the superior population to generate the new individuals and a mechanism is proposed to update the probability model. At the local exploitation phase, different operators are well designed for the two sub-populations to generate neighbor individuals and a local search strategy based on critical path is proposed to enhance the exploitation ability. In addition, the influence of parameters is investigated based on Taguchi method of design of experiment, and a suitable parameter setting is determined. Finally, numerical simulation based on some widely used benchmark instances is carried out. The comparisons between BEDA and some existing algorithms as well as the single-population based EDA demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed BEDA in solving the FJSP.",

    "abstract": "There is a no unique relationship between the trajectory of the hand, represented in cartesian or extrinsic space, and its trajectory in joint angle or intrinsic space in the general condition of joint redundancy. The goal of this work is to analyze the relation between planning the trajectory of a multijoint movement in these two coordinate systems. We show that the cartesian trajectory can be planned based on the task parameters (target coordinates, etc.) prior to and independently of angular trajectories. Angular time profiles are calculated from the cartesian trajectory to serve as a basis for muscle control commands. A unified differential equation that allows planning trajectories in cartesian and angular spaces simultaneously is proposed. Due to joint redundancy, each cartesian trajectory corresponds to a family of angular trajectories which can account for the substantial variability of the latter. A set of strategies for multijoint motor control following from this model is considered; one of them coincides with the frog wiping reflex model and resolves the kinematic inverse problem without inversion. The model trajectories exhibit certain properties observed in human multijoint reaching movements such as movement equifinality, straight end-point paths, bell-shaped tangential velocity profiles, speed-sensitive and speed-insensitive movement strategies, peculiarities of the response to double-step targets, and variations of angular trajectory without variations of the limb end-point trajectory in cartesian space. In humans, those properties are almost independent of limb configuration, target location, movement duration, and load. In the model, these properties are invariant to an affine transform of cartesian space. This implies that these properties are not a special goal of the motor control system but emerge from movement kinematics that reflect limb geometry, dynamics, and elementary principles of motor control used in planning. All the results are given analytically and, in order to compare the model with experimental results, by computer simulations.",

In this paper, we develop a quantitative analysis for ongoing assessment of cognitive response by investigating the neurobiological brain dynamics in traffic-light experiments. A single-trial event-related-potential (ERP)-based fuzzy neural network (FNN) is applied to recognize different brain potentials stimulated by red/green/yellow traffic-light events. The system consists of a dynamic virtual-reality (VR)-based motion simulation platform, EEG signal detection and analysis units, and FNN-based classifier. ICA algorithms are used to obtain noise-free ERP signals from the multi-channel EEG signals. A novel temporal filter is also proposed to solve time-alignment problems of ERP features and PCA is used to reduce feature dimensions, which were then fed into a FNN classifier. Experimental results demonstrate the feasibility of detecting and analyzing multiple streams of ERP signals that organize operators' cognitive responses to task events. Comparisons of three kinds of linear and nonlinear classifiers show that our proposed FNN-based classifier can achieve a satisfactory and superior recognition rate (85%). The classification results can be further transformed as the control/biofeedback signals of intelligent driving systems.",

Then, a wireless communication network is set up. Finally, real-time manufacturing could be achieved according to the reorganization of production. A case study is also introduced in this paper to illustrate how real-time manufacturing works through this platform in DI workshop. Limitations such as channel seeking and universal work flows configuration should be improved if this platform of great merits to extend to other industry. Keywords: RFID, Real-time Manufacturing, Hardware Platform, Discrete Industry. 1 Introduction Discrete industry (DI) refers to produce products which are assembled from a variety of components (Florent 2001). With the necessary components and products identified by ratios, these materials could not be less or more. Great many manufacturing fields are belonged to DI, such as machinery manufacturing, automobile manufacturing, household electrical appliance manufacturing, etc. DI dose not follow the traditional personality, but also takes on the dynamic characteristics: planning \u2192 complex scheduling \u2192 processing \u2192 design changes \u2192 dynamic scheduling \u2192 feedback (Zhong et al 2008). As one of the primary industry in China, DI follows such personalized features: \u2022 DI productions are so complex that one component contains several assemblies with the fixed relations and structures according to different orders; \u2022 DI enterprises produce series of products which are determined by source materials; \u2022 DI processes contain several sub-process or parallel processes which are consist of complicated procedures that are most probably ambivalent or momentary",

    "abstract": "Progress in computer technology over the last four decades has been spectacular, driven by Moore's law which, though initially an observation, has become a self-fulfilling prophecy and a boardroom planning tool. Although Gordon Moore expressed his vision of progress simply in terms of the number of transistors that could be manufactured economically on an integrated circuit, the means of achieving this progress was based principally on shrinking transistor dimensions, and with that came collateral gains in performance, power-efficiency and, last but not least, cost. The semiconductor industry appears to be confident in its ability to continue to shrink transistors, at least for another decade or so, but the game is already changing. We can no longer assume that smaller circuits will go faster, or be more power-efficient. As we approach atomic limits, device variability is beginning to hurt, and design costs are going through the roof. These are impacting the economics of design in ways that will affect the entire computing and communications industries. For example, on the desktop there is a trend away from high-speed uniprocessors towards multi-core processors, despite the fact that general-purpose parallel programming remains one of the greatest unsolved problems of computer science. If computers are to benefit from future advances in technology then there are major challenges ahead, involving understanding how to build reliable systems on increasingly unreliable technology and how to exploit parallelism increasingly effective, not only to improve performance, but also to mask the consequences of component failure. Biological systems demonstrate many of the properties we aspire to incorporate into our engineered technology, so perhaps that suggests a possible source of ideas that we could seek to incorporate into future novel computation systems?",

    "abstract": "New integrated wireless and mobile networks are emerging to offer a wide range of services through heterogeneous networks anywhere at any time. The promotion towards these networks requires a user-centric approach which could enable users to control their terminal behavior in an efficient way. Each mobile terminal equipped with heterogeneous interfaces can access different network technologies and perform the corresponding services. In this paper, we consider a network selection strategy based on the estimated Signal to Interference-plus-Noise Ratio (SINR) value in an integrated heterogeneous network. Based on the Markov model, we describe the state of the heterogeneous system at any time, taking into account the quality of service (QoS) requirements of all users communicating in the heterogeneous networks. Then we analyze the system performance in terms of the blocking probabilities and connection quality of calls. Moreover, resource blocks allocation for services with different QoS requirements is also analyzed in this paper.",

    "abstract": "The performance of a set of linear reduced-rank multistage filter banks is studied in the context of multiuser detection for direct-sequence (DS) code-division multiple-access (CDMA) systems. The set of filter banks under consideration is comprised of the minimum mean-square error (MMSE), the minimum output energy (MOE), the best linear unbiased estimator (BLUE), and the maximum-likelihood (ML) detector. Based on a common framework for the multistage implementations of the aforementioned filter banks, the signal-to-interference plus noise ratios (SINRs) and bit-error rates (BERs) of these reduced-rank filter banks are studied for multipath Rayleigh-fading channels. A generic BER formula is provided for coherent detection and noncoherent differential detection schemes constructed under this common framework. Analysis shows that all of these performance measures are characterized by a kernel matrix K/sub mmse/ whose trace forms the output SINR of the MMSE filter bank. Through investigating the recursive structure of K/sub mmse/, the output SINRs are proven to be monotonically increasing with the number of stages and upper-bounded by a number equal to the paths of the desired user's channel. The condition for asymptotically achieving this upper bound is also provided, which leads to the notion of effective user capacity of linear reduced-rank multiuser detection as well as serves as a test for the existence of a BER floor for coherent detection. In addition, the channel mismatch due to differential detection is also shown to yield a BER floor for noncoherent detection. Based on this analysis, a simple yet effective rule for choosing the number of stages is provided for both coherent and noncoherent linear multistage multiuser detection.",

For image set of a specific category or a mixture of multiple categories, we have built a sparsity model to reconstruct all its images by using a subset of most representative images (i.e., image summary); and we adopted the simulated annealing algorithm to learn such sparse dictionary by minimizing an explicit optimization function. By investigating their reconstruction ability under sparsity constrain and diversity constrain, we have quantitatively measure the performance of various summarization algorithms. Our experimental results have shown that our dictionary learning for sparse representation algorithm can obtain more accurate summary as compared with other baseline algorithms.",

The interference to the PU resulting from the transmission from the cognitive nodes is kept below a specified limit. We propose joint relay selection and optimal power allocation among the secondary user (SU) nodes achieving maximum throughput under transmit power and PU interference constraints.

In the experiments, different from the assumption in computer simulation of previous researches, a fixed distortion component caused by a direct current offset is observed. It is shown that the overlapped FFT scheme also works effectively under the existence of the fixed distortion. Numerical results obtained through the experiments show that the overlapped FFT scheme improves the detection probability by up to 0.15 with the noise and the fixed distortion component.

    "abstract": "TCP is the dominant transport protocol over both wired and wireless links. It is however, well known that TCP is not suitable for wireless networks and several solutions have been proposed to rectify this shortcoming. In this work, we explore cross-layer optimization of the rate  adaptation  feature of cellular networks to optimize throughput of a single long-lived TCP session. Modern cellular networks rate RF technology that allows them to dynamically vary the wireless channel rate in response to user demand and channel conditions. However, the set of data rates as well as the scheduler's rate adaptation policy are typically chosen to optimize throughput for  inelastic  applications. In order to optimize such a system for TCP, we propose a  two state  TCP-aware scheduler that switches between two chanrates as a function of the TCP sending rate. We develop a fluid model of the steady-state behavior of a TCP session in such a system and derive analytical expressions for TCP throughput that explicitly account for rate variability as well as the dependency between the scheduler and TCP. Using the model we choose RF layer parameters that, in conjunction with the TCP-aware scheduler, improve term throughput of a single TCP flow by 15.25%. We also compare our analytical results against those obtained from  ns-2  simulations and confirm that our model indeed closely approximates TCP behavior in such an environment.",

    "abstract": "The provisioning of wireless data services in the railway environment will become increasingly important for train operators and train constructors in the upcoming years. In this paper, we present models to predict train-to-wayside wireless data communications characteristics in terms of throughput, jitter, and packet loss predictions for 2G/3G networks. To this end, an extensive measurement campaign is carried out along a Belgian Intercity railway track. Based on these measurements, we apply a multiple regression, window mean, and autoregressive model. We find that the window mean model is recommended for the prediction of throughput and jitter, while the multiple regression model is more favorable for the prediction of packet loss. The implementation of these predictions in train-to-wayside communication systems can enhance the provisioning of seamless network connection necessary for a wide variety of data services.",

When coming to combat piracy, we provided some business scenarios where it is essential to offer traceability in order to protect the revenues drawn from the provided services.

    "abstract": "In periodic manner the analysts teams are in the process of designing, updating and verifying the situational awareness SWA system. Initially, at the designing stage the risk assessment model has little information about the dynamic environment. Hence, any missing information can directly impact the situational assessment capabilities. With this in mind, researchers relied on various performance metrics in order to verify how well they were doing in assessing different situations. In fact, before measuring the ranking capabilities of the SWA system, the underlying performance metrics should be examined against its intended purpose. In this paper, we have conducted quality based evaluations for the performance metrics, namely \"The Ranking Capability Score\". The results obtained showed that the proposed performance metrics have scaled well over a number of scenarios. Indeed, from the data fusion perspectives the underlying metrics have adequately satisfied different SWA system needs and configurations.",

    "abstract": "In pervasive computing environment the low-level context data provided by the sensors are usually meaningless, and thus higher-level context needs to be extracted. Situation is the semantic interpretation of low-level context, permitting a higher-level specification of human behavior in the scene and the corresponding system service. Context modeling and reasoning are the two key parts in the situation awareness. In this paper we present a multiple level architecture for context modeling, and a reasoning approach based on the Dempster-Shafer Theory (DST) and semantic similarity. The Dempster-Shafer theory is employed to analyze low-level context and eliminate the conflict among different sensors. Semantic similarity is used to reason out the higher-level context information based on the ontology. Computer simulation reveals that the proposed approach allows more efficient and accurate reasoning of higher-level context information compared to the existing approach.",

Our answer to this question is no. The main argument is simple enough: we lay out some constraints that a theoretically useful notion of domain specificity, in the context of the highly modular mind, would need to meet. We then survey a host of accounts of what domain specificity is, based on the intuitive idea that a domain specific mechanism is restricted in the kind of information that it processes, and show that each fails at least one of those constraints.",

    "abstract": "In this paper, a heuristic approach to automated nipple detection in digital mammograms is presented. A multithresholding algorithm is first applied to segment the mammogram and separate the breast region from the background region. Next, the problem is considered separately for craniocaudal (CC) and mediolateral-oblique (MLO) views. In the simplified algorithm, a search is performed on the segmented image along a band around the centroid and in a direction perpendicular to the pectoral muscle edge in the MLO view image. The direction defaults to the horizontal (perpendicular to the thoracic wall) in case of CC view images. The farthest pixel from the base found in this direction can be approximated as the nipple point. Further, an improved version of the simplified algorithm is proposed which can be considered as a subclass of the Branch and Bound algorithms. The mean Euclidean distance between the ground truth and calculated nipple position for 500 mammograms from the Digital Database for Screening Mammography (DDSM) database was found to be 11.03 mm and the average total time taken by the algorithm was 0.79 s. Results of the proposed algorithm demonstrate that even simple heuristics can achieve the desired result in nipple detection thus reducing the time and computational complexity.",

    "abstract": "Native speakers of Mandarin produce and perceive tones in ways that depend on the focus with which each word is produced [1]. This paper gives one approach to improving tone recognition algorithms using focus, by training different support vector machines on syllables conditional on their position with respect to the focused word in a sentence. In a four-way tone classification task on focus-labelled laboratory Mandarin speech data collected by Xu [2], error rates improve from 15.2% without using focus to 8.7% when using focus. Using the fact that tones on syllables in focused words are especially easy to recognize, we propose a tone recognition algorithm that makes use of focus without requiring focus labels in either training or test set. The algorithm has an error rate of 9.8% on this data set.",

    "abstract": "In 1989---1990, two new hash functions were presented, Snefru and MD4. Snefru was soon broken by the newly introduced differential cryptanalysis, while MD4 remained unbroken for several more years. As a result, newer functions based on MD4, e.g., MD5 and SHA-1, became the de-facto and international standards. Following recent techniques of differential cryptanalysis for hash function, today we know that MD4 is even weaker than Snefru. In this paper we apply recent differential cryptanalysis techniques to Snefru, and devise new techniques that improve the attacks on Snefru further, including using generic attacks with differential cryptanalysis, and using virtual messages with second preimage attacks for finding preimages. Our results reduce the memory requirements of prior attacks to a negligible memory, and present a preimage of 2-pass Snefru. Finally, some observations on the padding schemes of Snefru and MD4 are discussed.",

One major limitation of using this technique is the narrow view of the endoscope and the lack of proper 3D context of the surgical site. In this paper, we propose a rapid and accurate method to align intraoperative stereo endoscopic images of the surgical site with preoperative Magnetic Resonance (MR) images. Gridline light pattern is projected on the surgical site to facilitate the registration. The purpose of this surface-based registration is to provide 3D context of the surgical site to the endoscopic view.

As far as the non-interactive part of the application is concerned, designers can find support in the field of software engineering, using object-oriented design methods for example. With regard to the user interface per se, a number of interactive tools (interface builders) are available, that allows creating interactively the look and feel of the interface. However, relating an object-oriented design with a proper user-interface design is still a matter of craft and experience, and few techniques permit the seamless integration of the two.The work presented here aims at bridging this gap. The paper proposes a visual language, based on Petri nets, for the design of the dialogue of interactive systems. This language allows specifying both activation and rendering on the one hand, and provides a seamless integration with an object-oriented design on the other.",

    "abstract": "Large data warehouses (DW) put a major challenge in what concerns performance and scalability, as users request instant answers to their queries. Traditional solutions relying on very expensive architectures and structures cannot turn every complex aggregation query into minutes or seconds answers. The summary warehouse (SW) achieves such a speedup using only general-purpose sampling summaries well fit for aggregated exploration analysis. The major limitation of SWs results from the tradeoff between accuracy and speed: smaller, faster summaries cannot answer less-aggregated queries. We propose a simple and cheap strategy to meet these conflicting requirements and deliver unseen speedup by taking advantage of distributed computation ubiquity. The distributed summaries approach (DS) proposed in this paper manages a distributed set of summaries that are put in available computing nodes of a local area network to achieve very fast query processing, while guaranteeing enough accuracy.",

    "abstract": "Despite its simplicity there exists, as yet, no position-based routing that is suitable for dynamic networks: Existing schemes construct subgraphs or overlays that come at a cost that may be too high. In a network where nodes are mobile, such constructions risk becoming stale before they become stable, potentially invalidating routing decisions.   In this work we are investigating position-based routing for dynamic networks based on left- or right-hand rule (LHR). A node using LHR forwards messages to the neighbour that sits next in rotational order. When used to recover from greedy routing failures, LHR guarantees success if implemented over planar graphs; for this reason it is often called 'face-routing'. We note, however, that if planarity is violated then LHR is only guaranteed to eventually return to the point of origin. We have chosen LHR for two reasons. First, it is most prevalent in position-based routing literature and hence well-studied. Second, it is a simple rule requiring little-to-no overhead.   We have started by looking for the specific causes of failure in LHR with the hope that we might quickly recognise and avoid them in mobile environments [1]. First, in the unit disc graph where communication ranges are normalised to 1, we analyze the way in which intersecting links may interact to invoke sides of a 4-gon (Figure 1a). We have provably enumerated all possible configurations to three possible cases. Surprisingly, only one of these configurations is able to defeat LHR. This is because there are two distinct traversals, each of which has the potential to restrict exit points in the other. We call this the 'umbrella' configuration due to its appearance.",

    "abstract": "In order to calculate the sample size for a clinical trial with a binary outcome needed to achieve a certain power at a given significance level, one needs to specify the clinically relevant effect as well as the event rate pooled over the treatment groups. However, before conducting the trial the event rates are unknown and the pooled event rate needs to be estimated. A misspecification of this parameter might lead to a study that is either under- or overpowered. In the internal pilot study design the pooled event rate is reestimated during the trial. For this reestimation the current methods only use data of those patients that have concluded the whole study. Instead, a method is proposed that also takes into account data at an earlier point of the trial, a point which, within the internal pilot study, has been passed by a greater number of patients than the trial's endpoint. Characteristics of the proposed estimator and the related recalculated sample size are investigated. Analytical computations of the actual type I-error rate are given for small sizes of the internal pilot study. These calculations are completed by simulation studies for larger sample sizes of the internal pilot study. The results show that the inflation of the type I-error rate is often negligible and generally not higher than observed for the fixed sample size design and for the classical recalculation procedure. However, as compared to the conventional approach the proposed procedure may show a considerably lower variability of the resulting sample size and thus an improved ability to achieve the target power.",

Based on scale space theory, we propose a bilateral vertex normal estimation algorithm for point-sampled models. We adaptively construct multiple local polygonal rings for each vertex after a multi-layer neighbor decomposition, the vertex normals are then computed by applying a bilateral estimation scheme on the multi-layer neighbors. A brief survey of vertex normal estimation on point-sampled surfaces is also presented in this paper, and the detailed comparisons of the different methods on theoretical basis, time and space complexity, applied environments, numerical implementations and effects with different initial conditions are analyzed.",

    "abstract": "Human pose estimation from depth data has made significant progress in recent years and commercial sensors estimate human poses in real-time. However, state-of-the-art methods fail in many situations when the humans are partially occluded by objects. In this work, we introduce a semantic occlusion model that is incorporated into a regression forest approach for human pose estimation from depth data. The approach exploits the context information of occluding objects like a table to predict the locations of occluded joints. In our experiments on synthetic and real data, we show that our occlusion model increases the joint estimation accuracy and outperforms the commercial Kinect 2 SDK for occluded joints.",

This algorithm is based on the assumption that the spectral signatures of pixels in the same class lie in a low-dimensional subspace and thus a test sample can be represented by a sparse linear combination of the training samples. The sparse representation is recovered by solving a constrained optimization and it directly determines the class label of the test sample. In addition to the constraints on sparsity and reconstruction accuracy, the smoothness of hyperspectral images across neighboring pixels is also exploited by forcing the Laplacian of the reconstructed image to be minimum in the optimization process. Various sparse recovery techniques are applied to solve the optimization problem and their performances are compared against the widely used Support Vector Machine classifier. Simulation results show that the proposed algorithm yields a favorable performance over the support vector machines.",

A class of the approaches is based on the approximation of the pairwise comparison matrix by a consistent matrix. In the paper this approximation problem is considered in the least-squares sense. In general, the problem is nonconvex and difficult to solve, since it may have several local optima. In the paper the classic logarithmic transformation is applied and the problem is transcribed into the form of a separable programming problem based on a univariate function with special properties. We give sufficient conditions of the convexity of the objective function over the feasible set. If such a sufficient condition holds, the global optimum of the original problem can be obtained by local search, as well. For the general case, we propose a branch-and-bound method.

SyD-enabled Web objects allow us to create a collaborative application rapidly with limited coding. In this case study, the modular software architecture allowed us to hide the inherent heterogeneity among devices, data stores, and networks by presenting a uniform and persistent object view of mobile calendar objects interacting through XML/SOAP requests and responses.

    "abstract": "Many potential applications of adaptive control, such as adaptive flight control systems, require that the controller have high performance, stability guarantees, and robustness to time delays. These requirements typically lead to engineering trade-offs, such as a trade-off between performance and robustness. In this paper, a new Composite Adaptive Posicast Control (CAPC) framework is proposed for linear time-invariant (LTI) plants with input-matched parametric uncertainties and known delay. The CAPC architecture uses a combination of several modifications to the typical direct model reference adaptive control (MRAC). The described approach is a nonlinear controller design that explicitly accounts for known time delay. The stability of the overall closed-loop system can be guaranteed using nonlinear analysis tools. The benefits of the CAPC approach are explored using a simulation of the longitudinal dynamics of a fixed-wing aircraft. Comparison studies are presented for 80 ms and 250 ms time delay cases.",

    "abstract": "The technical feasibility of applying a fiber-optic multilevel QAM (quadrature amplitude modulation) subcarrier multiplexing scheme to a multichannel conventional TV signal transport is explored. This transport scheme has some advantageous features. Because a digital subcarrier modulation scheme is used, a high-quality transmission performance is expected to be achieved, if the bit error is sufficiently small over a transmission line and the required carrier-to-noise ratio (CNR) is relatively small among the many candidates of subcarrier modulation schemes. The use of multilevel modulation allows the bandwidth to be efficiently utilized; consequently, up to 40-channel uncompressed digital TV signals are estimated to be accommodated in the frequency region of the VHF and UHF bands, where well-developed and inexpensive electronics can be easily applied. >",

    "abstract": "Group key agreement is a fundamental building block for secure peer group communication systems. Several group key management techniques were proposed in the last decade, all assuming the existence of an underlying group communication infrastructure to provide reliable and ordered message delivery as well as group membership information. Despite analysis, implementation, and deployment of some of these techniques, the actual costs associated with group key management have been poorly understood so far. This resulted in an undesirable tendency: on the one hand, adopting suboptimal security for reliable group communication, while, on the other hand, constructing excessively costly group key management protocols.This paper presents a thorough performance evaluation of five notable distributed key management techniques (for collaborative peer groups) integrated with a reliable group communication system. An in-depth comparison and analysis of the five techniques is presented based on experimental results obtained in actual local- and wide-area networks. The extensive performance measurement experiments conducted for all methods offer insights into their scalability and practicality. Furthermore, our analysis of the experimental results highlights several observations that are not obvious from the theoretical analysis.",

    "abstract": "In this paper, an efficient feature selection method based on a combination of DCT pyramid for image decomposition and the concept of the set partitioning in hierarchal trees (SPIHT) for structuring of information for face recognition is presented. In the proposed method, the DCT pyramid decomposes each face image into an approximation subband and a set of reversed L-shape blocks containing the high frequency coefficients. The generalized parent-child relationships of SPIHT algorithm are then established among the DCT pyramids. This leads to efficient selection of the most important coefficients among the layers of the DCT pyramid. Experimental results on the standard ORL and FERET databases show that the proposed method achieves more accurate face recognition than the wavelet-based SPIHT feature selection. Moreover, it outperforms the other well-known methods such as the Eigenfaces and the block-based DCT with the zigzag scanning structure in terms of both accuracy and memory requirement.",

    "abstract": "Female breast cancer is a major cause of deaths in occidental countries. Computer-aided Detection (CAD) systems can aid radiologists to increase diagnostic accuracy. In this work, we present a comparison between two classifiers applied to the separation of normal and abnormal breast tissues from mammograms. The purpose of the comparison is to select the best prediction technique to be part of a CAD system. Each region of interest is classified through a Support Vector Machine (SVM) and a Bayesian Neural Network (BNN) as normal or abnormal region. SVM is a machine-learning method, based on the principle of structural risk minimization, which shows good performance when applied to data outside the training set. A Bayesian Neural Network is a classifier that joins traditional neural networks theory and Bayesian inference. We use a set of measures obtained by the application of the semivariogram, semimadogram, covariogram, and correlogram functions to the characterization of breast tissue as normal or abnormal. The results show that SVM presents best performance for the classification of breast tissues in mammographic images. The tests indicate that SVM has more generalization power than the BNN classifier. BNN has a sensibility of 76.19% and a specificity of 79.31%, while SVM presents a sensibility of 74.07% and a specificity of 98.77%. The accuracy rate for tests is 78.70% and 92.59% for BNN and SVM, respectively.",

    "abstract": "We propose an efficient acceleration structure for real-time screen-space ray tracing. The hybrid data structure represents the scene geometry by combining a bounding volume hierarchy with local planar approximations. This enables fast empty space skipping while tracing and yields exact intersection points for the planar approximation. In combination with an occlusion-aware ray traversal our algorithm is capable to quickly trace even multiple depth layers. Compared to prior work, our technique improves the accuracy of the results, is more general, and allows for advanced image transformations, as all pixels can cast rays to arbitrary directions. We demonstrate real-time performance for several applications, including depth-of-field rendering, stereo warping, and screen-space ray traced reflections.",

Participants (N=224) retrieved their most recent text messages which were then analyzed with the Linguistic Inquiry and Word Count (LIWC) program (Pennebaker et al., 2007a,b) and compared with parallel analyses of randomly selected telephone conversations (N=214). The results indicated numerous linguistic differences between text messages and telephone conversations. The former were linguistically simpler, more personal and more affective than the latter. Overall, the results further our understanding of the linguistic dimensions of this relatively new form of communication.",

We found out two issues of the original 2D-CORDIC operations which would increase the errors of the calculated angles. Hence, we propose the solutions to further enhance the precision of tilting angles calculated in the algorithm. We also evaluate the performance of our algorithm on 5 different platforms with different processor cores ranging from low-end micro-controllers to high-end desktop CPU. The results indicate that the algorithm is extremely suitable for implementation on low cost and low power micro-controllers to perform the real-time and in-line tilting angle computations for its low computation complexity and low memory requirements. As the results, precise tilting angles can be obtained in real-time with a low cost embedded system to be applied in various applications including medical care systems.",

In most practical grammars this special case does not in fact arise. Since the elimination of unit productions both reduces the size of the parser and increases its speed, it is of value to have a general method for achieving this objective.#R##N##R##N#The algorithm provided eliminates from the parser all nonterminals that occur as left-hand sides of unit productions. This substantially contributes to the reduction in size obtained, and also provides a solution to an open problem by Aho and Ullman [3].

    "abstract": "The aim of this project was to implement a just-in-time hints help system into a real time strategy (RTS) computer game that would deliver information to the user at the time that it would be of the most benefit. The goal of this help system is to improve the user's learning in terms of their rate of learning, retention and avoidance of stagnation. The first stage of this project was implementing a computer game to incorporate four different types of skill that the user must acquire, namely motor, perceptual, declarative knowledge and strategic. Subsequently, the just-in-time hints help system was incorporated into the game to assess the user's knowledge and deliver hints accordingly. The final stage of the project was to test the effectiveness of this help system by conducting two phases of testing. The goal of this testing was to demonstrate an increase in the user's assessment of the helpfulness of the system from phase one to phase two. The results of this testing showed that there was no significant difference in the user's responses in the two phases. However, when the results were analysed with respect to several categories of hints that were identified, it became apparent that patterns in the data were beginning to emerge. The conclusions of the project were that further testing with a larger sample size would be required to provide more reliable results and that factors such as the user's skill level and different types of goals should be taken into account.",

An alternative weighted factorization algorithm is proposed to handle noisy image measurement. The novelty and main contributions of the paper are as follows: (i) A simple while accurate quasi-perspective projection model is adopted for structure and motion factorization; (ii) feature uncertainties are estimated directly from image reprojection residuals; (iii) an alternative weighted factorization scheme is proposed to reduce the influence of noisy data; and (iv) the proposed scheme is proved empirically to be more accurate than other factorization algorithms. The proposed approach is validated by extensive experiments on synthetic data and real images.",

    "abstract": "Hydraulic actuators are well-known for their high power-to-weight ratio, rapid responses, compactness and reliable performance. However, one of the drawbacks of fluid power systems have been large energy losses. In this paper, our research objective is to develop both energy-efficient and high performance motion controller for heavy-duty hydraulic manipulators. We apply an unconventional Servo Meter-In Meter-Out (SMIMO) hydraulic valve control setup that is used to decouple hydraulic actuator load pressure level from load force to improve energy efficiency. The developed control system is based on the Virtual Decomposition Control (VDC) approach to guarantee the closed-loop system stability of the multi degree of freedom heavy-duty hydraulic crane driven by the proposed novel SMIMO VDC controller. Capability for approximately 42% lower energy consumption was achieved in the Cartesian motion trajectory experiments with the proposed novel controller compared with a conventional 4-way servo valve setup, without significant control performance deterioration.",

Safety devices for electric automatic gates, mainly photodetectors, with their reduced sensing capabilities, can not provide the complete avoidance of injuries so that to guarantee protection for people crossing the danger area additional devices must be introduced. In this paper the authors evaluate as safety sensor a solo vision system fitting sliding and swing gates, the most widespread gate sorts for residential, commercial and industrial automations. Two cameras are placed at the opposite ends of the gate doorway looking at the same area to be monitored. The evaluation is carried out on both virtual and real image sequences in order to verify the practical suitability of the system after the theoretical trials exploitation.",

    "abstract": "This work addresses the issues of actuator fault detection and isolation for diesel engines. We are particularly interested to diagnosis faults affecting the Exhaust Gas Recirculation (EGR) and the variable Nozzle Turbine (VNT) actuator valves. To accomplish this goal, a residual generator based on a nonlinear mean value model of the diesel engine is proposed using a bank of observer. Each residual on the proposed scheme is based on a nonlinear unknown input observer and designed to be insensitive to only one fault. By using this kind of scheme, the actuator faults can be easily isolated since only one residual goes to zero while the others do not. A decision algorithm based on multi-CUSUM is used. The performances of the proposed approach are shown through the application to a diesel engine model.",

To demonstrate the application of the framework, and to determine the current software product family business performance, we conducted a case study of an organization actively involved in the business of software product family. The framework and the tool provide direct mechanisms to evaluate the current maturity level of software product family business of an organization.

The primary user has highest priority to access a primary channel whereas at the same time tunes the cognitive radio to sense and access to another primary channel if more throughput is needed. At the beginning of each time slot, the primary user, aiming at maximizing its expected throughput, estimates available energy to take an optimal action from a set of possible actions: sleeping, spectrum sensing and/or accessing, and transmitting. The problem is formulated as a Markov decision process.

Therefore, dual polarization antenna scheme is introduced in the system to provide multiplexing gain and/or diversity gain.

Furthermore, the performance of dual polarization scheme under different MIMO architectures is presented and analyzed. It is shown that polarization scheme can achieve similar average throughput and successful transmission ratio compared with spatial separation scheme in various scenarios.",

In the search for the best compromise solution for conflicting and noncommensurate objectives, a quasiconcave preference structure (utility function) is used that is more flexible and general than pseudoconcave, concave, and linear utility functions. Since the complete assessment of such a utility function is very difficult or impossible, an interactive method is developed in which, with a minimum of simple questions to the decision-maker (DM), the best compromise solution can be obtained. The DM responds to either paired comparison or simple trade-off questions. Conversion of tradeoff questions to paired comparison is discussed. The method also uses linear approximations of the nonlinear utility function to improve convergence rate. A procedure is provided for identifying efficient tradeoffs on the efficient facet so that only efficient alternatives are generated. Convergence with a limited number of questions is proven for quasiconcave and pseudoconcave utility functions. >",

A set of conditions are proposed to guarantee the convergence of nonlinear Lagrangian algorithms, to analyze condition numbers of nonlinear Lagrangian Hessians as well as to develop the dual approaches. These conditions are satisfied by well-known nonlinear Lagrangians appearing in literature. The convergence theorem shows that the dual algorithm based on any nonlinear Lagrangian in the class is locally convergent when the penalty parameter is less than a threshold under a set of suitable conditions on problem functions and the error bound solution, depending on the penalty parameter, is also established. The paper also develops the dual problems based on the proposed nonlinear Lagrangians, and the related duality theorem and saddle point theorem are demonstrated. Furthermore, it is shown that the condition numbers of Lagrangian Hessians at optimal solutions are proportional to the controlling penalty parameters. We report some numerical results obtained by using nonlinear Lagrangians.",

    "abstract": "We address the problem of blind carrier frequency-offset (CFO) estimation in quadrature amplitude modulation, phase-shift keying, and pulse amplitude modulation communications systems. We study the performance of a standard CFO estimate, which consists of first raising the received signal to the Mth power, where M is an integer depending on the type and size of the symbol constellation, and then applying the nonlinear least squares (NLLS) estimation approach. At low signal-to noise ratio (SNR), the NLLS method fails to provide an accurate CFO estimate because of the presence of outliers. In this letter, we derive an approximate closed-form expression for the outlier probability. This enables us to predict the mean-square error (MSE) on CFO estimation for all SNR values. For a given SNR, the new results also give insight into the minimum number of samples required in the CFO estimation procedure, in order to ensure that the MSE on estimation is not significantly affected by the outliers",

    "abstract": "Network coding is famous for its capability in significantly improving the throughput of network. The successful decoding of the network coded data relies on some side information of the original data. In that framework, independent data flows are usually decoded first and then network coded by relay nodes. If appropriate signal design is adopted, physical layer network coding is a natural way in wireless networks. In this work, a network coding tree algorithm which enhances the efficiency of the multiple access system (MAS) is presented. For MAS, researchers try to avoid the collisions but collisions happen frequently under heavy load. By introducing network coding into MAS, our proposed algorithm achieves a better trade-off between average delay and system throughput. When multiple users transmit signal in a time slot, the sum signals are saved and used to jointly decode the collided frames after some component frames of the network coded frame are received. Splitting tree structure is extended to our proposed algorithm for collision solving. The system throughput and average delay of frames are presented in a recursive way. Besides, extensive simulations show that network coding tree algorithm enhances the system performance in terms of system throughput and average frame delay compared with other algorithms.",

In this work we propose a two level caching archi- tecture (disk and memory) and benchmark different caching strategies in a distributed machine learning setup over a cluster with no shared RAM memory. Our results strongly favour strategies where (1) datasets are partitioned and preloaded throughout the distributed memory of the cluster nodes and (2) algorithms use data locality information to syn- chronize computations at each iteration.

In this contribution the development of a memetic algorithm (MA) for global optimization in the solution of a problem in the chemical process engineering domain is described. The combination of an evolutionary strategy and a local solver based on the general reduced gradient method enables the exploitation of a significant reduction in the search space and of the ability of local mathematical programming solvers to efficiently handle large continuous problems containing equality constraints. The global performance of the MA is improved by the exclusion of regions that are defined by approximations of the basins of attraction of the local optima.

    "abstract": "When defining computations over syntax as data, one often runs into tedious issues concerning  \u03b1 -equivalence and semantically correct manipulations of binding constructs. Here we study a semantic framework in which these issues can be dealt with automatically by the programming language. We take the user-friendly \u201cnominal\u201d approach in which bound objects are named. In particular, we develop a version of Scott domains within nominal sets and define two programming languages whose denotational semantics are based on those domains. The first language,  \u03bb\u03bd -PCF, is an extension of Plotkin\u2019s PCF with names that can be swapped, tested for equality and locally scoped; although simple, it already exposes most of the semantic subtleties of our approach. The second language, PNA, extends the first with name abstraction and concretion so that it can be used for metaprogramming over syntax with binders.   For both languages, we prove a full abstraction result for nominal Scott domains analogous to Plotkin\u2019s classic result about PCF and conventional Scott domains: two program phrases have the same observable operational behaviour in all contexts if and only if they denote equal elements of the nominal Scott domain model. This is the first full abstraction result we know of for languages combining higher-order functions with some form of locally scoped names which uses a domain theory based on ordinary extensional functions, rather than using the more intensional approach of game semantics.   To obtain full abstraction, we need to add two functionals, one for existential quantification over names and one for \u201cdefinite description\u201d over names. Only adding one of them is not enough, as we give counter-examples to full abstraction in both cases.",

    "abstract": "In this paper, the authors consider a single machine scheduling problem with rejection. In traditional research, it is assumed all jobs must be processed. However, in the real-world situation, certain jobs can be rejected. In this study, the jobs can be either accepted and scheduled or be rejected at the cost of a penalty. Two objective functions are considered simultaneously: (1) minimization of the sum of weighted completion times for the accepted jobs, and (2) minimization of the sum of penalties for the rejected jobs. The authors apply two-phase method (TPM), which is a general technique to solve bi-objective combinatorial optimization problems, to find all supported and non-supported solutions for small-sized problems. The authors present a mathematical model for implementing both phases. On the other hand, three different bi-objective simulated annealing algorithms have also been developed to find a good estimation of Pareto-optimal solutions for large-sized problems. Finally the authors discuss the results obtained from each of these algorithms.",

Four-, eight-, and even 12-processor machines, constructed from basic, readily available PC components, can be obtained today for the same price as a good-quality single-processor workstation of a few years ago. Together with now well-established parallel tools (such as the message-passing interface (MPI) or parallel virtual machine (PVM) software), state-of-the-art, fully functioning, parallel machines using the Linux operating system and the latest PC microprocessors can deliver unprecedented price/performance ratios.

    "abstract": "Writing and drawing together on a common display often assist a working group in a task. For example,face-to-face groups have long enjoyed the richness of graphic communication found on blackboards. The spontaneous image manipulations which take place over time on a blackboard can be viewed as a  text-graphic performance . A human performer generates and manipulates text and graphics for the purpose of assisting the working group in their task.The phenomenon of performed text-graphics presents opportunities for research in the area of computer-supported cooperative work. 1] Spontaneous generation demands a  performing medium  where the focus is on  live  manipulation of text and graphics. Design of a computer-based medium with enough agility and generality to support blackboard-like activity is a challenge for interface design. 2] Agility and generality must not be achieved at the expense of specializability. After a group has initially sketched an idea in text and graphics, then that same medium should also support refining the sketch according to formal schema. 3] The performing medium can also be used as a recording medium for studying image manipulation as part of the working group process.This paper presents a stepwise approach to the design of a performing medium for working group graphics. First, examples of non-computer text-graphics for groups are examined to get a preliminary idea of the underlying phenomenon: the  performing  of text-graphic manipulation to assist working groups. Next key features of that kind of text-graphic manipulation are isolated. Then, third, the architecture and behavior of a graphics editor providing those features is described.",

    "abstract": "We propose a family of kernels for structured objects which is based on the bag-of-components paradigm. However, rather than decomposing each complex object into the single histogram of its components, we use for each object a family of nested histograms, where each histogram in this hierarchy describes the object seen from an increasingly granular perspective. We use this hierarchy of histograms to define elementary kernels which can detect coarse and fine similarities between the objects. We compute through an efficient averaging trick a mixture of such specific kernels, to propose a final kernel value which weights efficiently local and global matches. We propose experimental results on an image retrieval experiment which show that this mixture is an effective template procedure to be used with kernels on histograms.",

In this paper, we present an approach to biological sequence labeling that takes into account the global similarity between biological sequences. Our approach combines unsupervised and supervised learning techniques. Given a set of sequences and a similarity measure defined on pairs of sequences, we learn a mixture of experts model by using spectral clustering to learn the hierarchical structure of the model and by using bayesian approaches to combine the predictions of the experts. We evaluate our approach on two important biological sequence labeling problems: RNA-protein and DNA-protein interface prediction problems. The results of our experiments show that global sequence similarity can be exploited to improve the performance of classifiers trained to label biological sequence data.",

The stability of process is definitely one of the most important aspects to insure the quality of the machined part stably. Now it is still a challenge to put forward a useful model to deal with manufacturing process stability mathematically. This paper deals with the issue by the notion of manufacturing process reliability and its sensitivity. Based on state space model, process performance function which is used to describe the relations between key product characters (KPC) and key control characters (KCC) during machining process has been conducted. Furthermore, measurement index to process reliability is put forward, which leads the ways to calculate the process reliability mathematically. To determine the weakness during machining process, process reliability sensitivity has been put forward and the corresponding ways how to get its magnitude. Finally, A simple 2-D case study has been used to support and validate the proposed model. It shows that this way can calculate the process reliability effectively",

The joint problem of scheduling and sequencing isposed as a linear integer programming (IP) problem with additional nonlinear constraints.The problem is then solved by embedding an IP algorithm within an overall branch andbound approach.

    "abstract": "The mobile robot navigation with complex environment needs more input space to match the environmental data into robot outputs in order to perform realistic task. At the same time, the number of rules at the rule base needs to be optimized to reduce the computing time and to provide the possibilities for real time operation. In this paper, the optimization of fuzzy rules using a modified fuzzy associative memory (MFAM) is designed and implemented. MFAM provides good flexibility to use multiple input space and reduction of rule base for robot navigation. This paper presents the MFAM model to generate the rule base for robot navigation. The behavior rules obtained from MFAM model are tested using simulation and real world experiments, and the results are discussed in the paper and compared with the existing methods.",

    "abstract": "In the last decade, different computing paradigms and modelling frameworks for the description and simulation of biochemical systems based on stochastic modelling have been proposed. From a computational point of view, many simulations of the model are necessary to identify the behaviour of the system. The execution of thousands of simulation can require huge amount of time, therefore the parallelization of these algorithms is highly desirable. In this work we discuss the different strategies that can be implemented for the parallelization of a space aware \u03c4-DPP variant, that is proving a C-MPI implementation of the system and discussing its performances according to the simulation of a particle diffusion in a crowded environment.",

    "abstract": "Important operational performance measures for a successful firm include not only price and quality, but also fast and on time delivery of customer orders. Capacity is a key issue in determining the lead time from customer order to delivery. However, capacity planning models seldom consider the impact of capacity levels on lead time performance. An important characteristic of this paper is the incorporation of congestion effects and their impact on lead time in making capacity acquisition decisions. It is especially important in a make-to-order environment, where customer orders arrive randomly and lead to high variability and congestion. This work was motivated by our observations of such tradeoffs at firms in several industries. We present a model to make equipment choice decisions in a multi-product, multi-machine, and single-stage production environment with congestion effects. The model is a nonlinear integer program. We present a heuristic solution procedure for this problem, which is based on a lower bound for the formulation that can be solved efficiently. The computational study shows that the solution procedure is quite effective in solving industry size problems. We illustrate the application of the model using data from a chemical-testing laboratory. We also discuss various extensions of the model.",

    "abstract": "Detection and elimination of redundant clauses from propositional formulas in Conjunctive Normal Form (CNF) is a fundamental problem with numerous application domains, including AI, and has been the subject of extensive research. Moreover, a number of recent applications motivated various extensions of this problem. For example, unsatisfiable formulas partitioned into disjoint subsets of clauses (so-called groups) often need to be simplified by removing redundant groups, or may contain redundant variables, rather than clauses. In this report we present a generalized theoretical framework of labelled CNF formulas that unifies various extensions of the redundancy detection and removal problem and allows to derive a number of results that subsume and extend previous work. The follow-up reports contain a number of additional theoretical results and algorithms for various computational problems in the context of the proposed framework.",

    "abstract": "Wireless sensor networks are composed of a high number of very simple nodes where most of them have to perform the function of a router. Energy consumption of these nodes is important as power is supplied to the nodes by limited batteries, which circumscribe the lifetime of the links as well as the whole network. Some of the recent routing protocols are greedy on network lifetime by balancing the remaining energies among the nodes in the networks. Although, these algorithms help to maintain the stability of the network, they are not as cost effective as existing traditional routing algorithms. Our proposed method makes a tradeoff between the routing cost and network lifetime issues in route selection, and ensures a good compromise between these two conflicting interests.",

    "abstract": "The Stack Resource Policy (SRP) is a real-time synchronization protocol suitable for embedded systems for its simplicity. However, if SRP is applied to dynamic priority scheduling, the runtime overhead of job selection algorithms could affect the performance of the system seriously. To solve the problem, a job selection algorithm was proposed that uses a selection tree as a scheduling queue structure. The proposed algorithm selects a job in O(\u2308log2n\u2309) time, resulting in significant reduction in the run-time overhead of scheduler. In this paper, the correctness of the job selection algorithm is presented. Also, the job selection algorithm was implemented in GSM/GPRS handset with ARM7 processor to see its effectiveness on embedded systems. The experiments performed on the system show that the proposed algorithm can further utilize the processor by reducing the scheduling overhead.",

In order to reduce the power dissipation without sacrificing the speed performance, an intelligent power-saving scheme has been developed taking the advantage of non-volatility of MTJ devices. The power lines of 4-Transistor 2-MTJ nonvolatile memory cells are controlled by not only word line signals but also the internal power control signals supplied from the data-mask/power-gating units to only activate the currently accessed memory elements. The proof-of-concept chip for 128-dimension data vectors has been designed under a 90-nm 5-metal CMOS/MTJ hybrid technology, and the chip operation at 100MHz has been verified by SPICE simulation. Compared to the conventional 6T-SRAM architecture, the proposed architecture achieves the higher speed and up to 97% power reduction. Moreover, this architecture is also proved to be particularly suitable for the applications with higher dimension data vectors.",

The proposed filter is different from the Bilateral filter [Tomasi C, Manduchi R. Bilateral filtering for gray and color images. In: Proceedings of the IEEE internal conference on computer vision 1998. p. 836-46] and performs well under high-noise conditions. It is capable of smoothing Gaussian noise as well as retaining detailed information of images. It gives significant performance in terms of peak-signal-to-noise ratio (PSNR) and universal quality index (UQI) and outperforms many known existing spatial-domain and wavelet-domain filters.

As our purpose is the acceleration of the configuration process, estimating the decoder speed also plays a major role in our study. We evaluate a wide range of well-established compression algorithms and we also propose two methods specifically developed for compressing FPGA configuration bitstreams, one based on a static dictionary and the other on arithmetic coding. For the arithmetic coding we propose a statistical model that takes advantage of the particularities of the configuration bitstreams of the Virtex 4 FPGA family. We evaluate the efficiency of the proposed methods along with state of the art compression algorithms on a number of benchmark circuits, some selected from the available open source implementations and some synthetically generated. Our evaluations indicate that using modest resources we can achieve parity and even exceed comercial software in terms of compression ratio, and outperform all other traditional algorithms. All our implemented decompressors are shown to use less than 1.5% of the slices available on the FPGA device.",

    "abstract": "In the realm of multi-agent systems, migration refers to the ability of an agent to transfer itself from one embodiment such as a graphical avatar into different embodiments such as a robotic android. Embodied agents usually function in a dynamic, uncertain, and uncontrolled environment, and exploiting them is a chaotic and error-prone task which demands high-level behavioral controllers to be able to adapt to failure at lower levels of the system. The conditions in which space robotic systems such as spacecraft and rovers operate, inspire by necessity, the development of robust and adaptive control software. In this paper, we propose a generic architecture for migrating and autonomous agents inspired by onboard autonomy which enables the developers to tailor the agent's embodiment by defining a set of feasible actions and perceptions associated with the new body. Evaluation results suggest that the architecture supports migration by performing consistent deliberative and reactive behaviors.",

    "abstract": "The remotely sensed radiation of green vegetation canopy over the spectral region of 350-2500 nm typically mixes with three components of different optical properties, namely the leaf interior volume scattering, canopy surface polarized light and leaf internal emitted chlorophyll fluorescence (ChlF). They are tightly superimposed together but convey different information of vegetation. This study emphasizes the distinction of the three radiant fluxes above and disentangles them from the observed apparent radiance of Scindapsus aureus canopy by in-situ polarization measurements. Results demonstrate that the polarization measurement enables the quantitatively separation of the volume scattering, polarized light and ChlF. This study provides further understanding of light scattering properties of the vegetation canopy and particularly has the potential of allowing improvements of current reflectance-based vegetation models.",

    "abstract": "The thermo-structural analysis of ultrasonic wire bonding is performed by means of 3D finite element method. A special focus has been placed on monitoring the temperature rise during ultrasonic vibration. An equivalent method is used to simulate the wire and bond pad, where the large volumes of wire and bond pad are effectively reduced to small computational magnitudes. The history of temperature changes in the wire-bond pad-substrate interfaces influenced by varying bond forces and bond pad sizes is specifically studied. It is shown that the maximum bulk temperature obtained upon completion of ultrasonic vibration is far lower than the melting temperatures of the wire and bond pad materials, indicating that the bulk temperature rise due to ultrasonic vibration is not directly responsible for ultrasonic wire bonding. A large bond pad size usually leads to a lower temperature rise, and when the pad size reaches a certain value, the effect of bond pad size on temperature rise becomes insignificant. A higher bond force results in a marginally higher temperature rise than a lower bond force, which does not necessarily affect the wire bondability.",

    "abstract": "Millions of office workplaces are cleaned by a surprisingly small group of cleaning workers every day, however, cleaning companies struggle to recruit enough personnel these days. One solution to this challenge is to schedule available professionals for demanding tasks while relieving them from simpler activities which are transferred to a robotic cleaning assistant. Two of such tasks are floor cleaning and waste disposal which account for 70% of the daily cleaning efforts. This paper presents the world's first autonomous cleaning robot prototype that masters both of these tasks and whose development was accompanied by the advice of a large cleaning company. Besides a detailed description of the overall system and its individual components an evaluation is provided based on real world experiments. The results indicate that both cleaning tasks can be solved at high quality but with potential for increased efficiency to meet the required performance. Hence, the paper concludes with a discussion on measures necessary for the development of a commercial prototype.",

    "abstract": "In this paper, we propose a new technique to compute, in real time, the positions of robots in a cooperative play such as the pass-and-shoot play. To evaluate the positioning of the robot, we use the  Dominant Region (DR) diagram, which is a kind of a Voronoi diagram. In the DR diagram, the soccer field is divided into regions, each of which shows an area that a robot can reach faster than the other robots. This division is based on the time of arrival while the division by the Voronoi diagram is based on the distance of arrival. Though the DR diagram plays a primary role in the positioning of the robots, it has a serious problem of taking much computation time. To overcome this problem, we show an approximate calculation procedure to obtain the DR diagram, which realizes the real time computation, i.e. a computation within a frame time. Applying the approximate dominant diagram to the positioning of the robots for the pass play, we show, by the simulation study, #R##N#the DR diagram can be calculated in real time,#R##N#an appropriate position for the pass play can be obtained.",

    "abstract": "Computing the optimal portfolio policy of an investor facing capital gains tax is a challenging problem: because the tax to be paid depends on the price at which the security was purchased (the tax basis), the optimal policy is path dependent and the size of the problem grows exponentially with the number of time periods. Dammon et al. (2001, 2002, 2004), Garlappi et al. (2001), and Gallmeyer et al. (2001) address this problem byapproximating the exact tax basis by the weighted average purchase price. Our contribution is threefold. First, we show that the structure of the problem has several attractive features that can be exploited to determine the optimal portfolio policy using theexact tax basis via nonlinear programming. Second, we characterize the optimal portfolio policy in the presence of capital gains tax when using theexact tax basis. Third, we show that the certainty equivalent loss from using the average tax basis instead of the exact basis is very small: it is typically less than 1% for problems with up to 10 periods, and this result is robust to the choice of parameter values and to the presence of transaction costs, dividends, intermediate consumption, labor income, tax reset provision at death, and wash-sale constraints.",

The force prediction accuracy of all four fingers (thumb, index, middle and ring) is shown to be equivalent. In the x-direction, the force prediction error is 0.52N\u00b10.02N, 0.52N\u00b10.03N in the y-direction and 0.56N\u00b10.04N in the z-direction. In addition, the four fingers register with equal accuracy. Given these results, experiments may be performed using fingernail imaging to measure the individual finger forces during grasping, provided a finger-tracking system is implemented to allow a camera to keep the fingers in view.",

    "abstract": "This research presents a time-effective approach for mapping streambed and riparian zone extent from high spatial resolution LiDAR derived products, i.e., digital terrain model, terrain slope and plant projective cover. Geographic object based image analysis (GEOBIA) has proven useful for feature extraction from high spatial resolution image data because of the capacity to reduce effects of reflectance variations of pixels making up individual objects and to include contextual and shape information. This functionality increases the likelihood of developing transferable and automated mapping approaches. LiDAR data covered parts of the Werribee Catchment in Victoria, Australia, which is characterized by urban, agricultural, and forested land cover types. Field data of streamside vegetation structure and physical form properties were used for both calibration of the mapping routines and validation of the mapping results. To improve the transferability of the rule set, the GEOBIA approach was developed for an area representing different riparian zone environments, i.e., urbanized, agricultural and hilly forested areas. Results show that mapping streambed extent (R2 = 0.93, RMSE = 3.6 m, n = 35) and riparian zone extent (R2 = 0.74, RMSE = 3.9, n = 35) from LiDAR derived products can be automated using GEOBIA to enable derivation of spatial information in an accurate and time-effective manner suited for natural resource management agencies.",

Spectral phase information is impractical to obtain in these instances, due to the relatively short wavelength involved. In this paper a new algorithm for image reconstruction from localized spectral magnitude is presented. The algorithm is based on localized Fourier transform magnitudes and a single spatial sample to fully reconstruct an image. The process reconstructs successively larger image blocks, until the entire image is restored, using the spatial sample as initial data. It is shown, that even in cases where the spatial sample is badly corrupted, it has little effect on the reconstructed image.

    "abstract": "This technical note compares two coding (quantization) schemes for random projections in the context of sub-linear time approximate near neighbor search. The first scheme is based on uniform quantization while the second scheme utilizes a uniform quantization plus a uniformly random offset (which has been popular in practice). The prior work compared the two schemes in the context of similarity estimation and training linear classifiers, with the conclusion that the step of random offset is not necessary and may hurt the performance (depending on the similarity level). The task of near neighbor search is related to similarity estimation with importance distinctions and requires own study. In this paper, we demonstrate that in the context of near neighbor search, the step of random offset is not needed either and may hurt the performance (sometimes significantly so, depending on the similarity and other parameters).",

The four controllers are based on instantaneous reactive power (p-q), d-q coordinate formulation (d-q), unity power factor (UPF), and perfect harmonic cancellation (PHC) strategies. Detailed analysis and simulation results (performed with Simulink\\Matlab) are used to highlight the advantages and limitations of each control approach.",

    "abstract": "As the key building block for enabling network virtualization, virtual routers have attracted much attention recently. In a virtual router platform, multiple virtual router instances coexist, each with its own FIB (Forwarding Information Base). The small amount of high-speed memory in a physical router platform severely limits the number of FIBs supported, which leads to a scalability challenge. In this paper, we present a method towards TCAM (Ternary Content Addressable Memory) based scalable virtual routers, through a merged data structure that enables the sharing of prefixes from several FIBs in TCAMs. Based on this data structure, we propose two approaches to merge multiple FIBs in TCAMs, paving the way for scalable virtual routers. Experimental results show that, by using the two approaches for storing 14 full IPv4 FIBs, the TCAM memory requirement can be reduced by about 92% and 82% respectively, compared with the conventional approach of treating FIBs as independent entities.",

The Coordinate Measuring Machine (CMM) has been widely used in the BIW assembly industry. The process of BIW assembly is a non stationary time series. Leap, linear and periodical trends are three mean shifts of CMM data. This paper introduces one simple and applicable method to evaluate the BIW assembly quality with CMM data. Wavelet analysis is employed to separate the trend and variation in CMM data. The practical cases analysed by wavelet analysis prove the effectiveness of using variation to evaluate the BIW assembly quality. The data splitting error is estimated with Monte Carlo simulation.",

Unfortunately, it is computationally expensive. In this paper, we shall explore the implementation of a general multi-agent simulation system on a system with multiple GPUs acting as accelerators. In particular, we have ported the popular Java multi-agent simulation framework MASON to a nVidia CUDA-based multi-GPU setting. We evaluated our implementation over different numbers and types of nVidia GPUs. For our evaluation, we ported three models in the original version of MASON. On the well-known Boids model, we achieved a speedup of   187\u00d7      187  \u00d7        . Using a fictional model, we showed that speedup of up to   468\u00d7      468  \u00d7         is possible. In the paper, we shall also describe the detailed internals of our system, and the various issues we encountered and how they were solved.",

    "abstract": "Over the past years there has been an increasing interest in develop- ing distributed computation methods over wireless networks. A new communication paradigm has emerged where distributed algorithms such as consensus have played a key role in the development of such networks. A special case are wireless sensor networks (WSN) which have found application in a large variety of problems such as en- vironmental monitoring, surveillance, or localization, to cite a few. One major design issue in WSNs is energy efficiency. Nodes are typ- ically battery-powered devices and thus, it is critical to make a proper use of the scarce energy resources. This fact motivates the search for optimal conditions that favor the communication environment. It is well known that the rate at which the information is spread across the network depends on the topology of the network and that find- ing the optimal topology is a hard combinatorial problem. However, using convex optimization tools, we propose a method that tries to find the optimal topology in a consensus wireless network that uses broadcast messages. Our results show that exploiting the broadcast nature of the wireless channel leads to more energy efficient configu- rations than using dedicated unicast messages and that our algorithm performs very close to the optimal solution.",

    "abstract": "Remote Procedure Call (RPC) is a popular paradigm for interprocess communication in distributed systems. It is simple, flexible and powerful. However, most of the RPC systems today are synchronous in nature, and hence fail to exploit fully the parallelism inherent in distributed applications. In view of this, various asynchronous RPC systems have been designed and implemented to achieve higher parallelism while retaining the familiarity and simplicity of synchronous RPC. Asynchronous RPC calls do not block the caller (client) and the replies can be received as and when they are needed, thus allowing the client execution to proceed locally in parallel with the callee (server) invocation. Asynchronous RPC calls can be classified into two types depending on whether the calls return a value. Most asynchronous RPC systems only support calls that do not return a value, and few support both classes. In this paper, an analysis and comparison of various asynchronous RPC systems are presented.",

    "abstract": "Cross Language News story search (CLNSS) is concerned with finding documents describing the same events in documents in different languages. As well as supporting information retrieval (IR), CLNSS has other applications in mining parallel and comparable data across different languages. In this paper, we present an overview of the work carried out for our participation in the Cross Language !ndian News Story Search (CL!NSS) task at FIRE 2013. In the CL!NSS task we explored the problem of cross language news search for the English-Hindi language pair. English news stories are used as queries to seek similar news documents from Hindi news articles. Hindi being a resource-scarce language offers many challenges towards retrieving relevant news articles. We investigate and contrast translation of input queries from English to Hindi using the Google and Bing translation services. To support translation of out-of-vocabulary words we use the Google transliteration service. A key challenge of the CL!NSS task is formation of search queries from the English news articles, since they are much longer than the much shorter queries typically used in IR applications. To address this problem, we explore the use of summarization to extract a query from the input news documents, and use these summarized queries as the input to the cross language IR system. We explore the use of query expansion using pseudo relevance feedback (PRF) in the IR process, since this has been shown to be effective for cross language IR in many previous investigations. We also explore in detail the use of data fusion techniques over different sets of retrieved results obtained using diverse query formulation techniques. For the CL!NSS task our team submitted 3 main runs. The results of our best run was ranked first among official submissions based on NDCG@5 and NDCG@10 values and second for NDCG@1 values. For the 25 test queries the results of our best main run were NDCG@1 0.7400, NDCG@5 0.6809 and NDCG@10 0.7268. We present our methodology, official results and results of a number of post-task experiments that were conducted to further examine the cross language search problem. Our experiments reveal that query formulation plays a vital role in improving search results for news documents across different languages. Instead of using the complete news documents the summarized queries show better performance. Data fusion techniques also help to improve the performance of the system by boosting the rank of documents, thus improving the NDCG scores.",

We introduce a novel segmented interval list structure that allows AABB insertion and removal without requiring a full sort of the axes. This algorithm is well-suited to large environments in which many objects are not moving at once. We analyze and test implementations of sweep and prune that include subdivision, batch insertion and removal, and segmented interval lists. Our tests show these techniques provide higher performance than previous sweep and prune methods, and perform better than octrees in temporally coherent environments.",

    "abstract": "The main future challenge of pervasive computing consists in offering access anywhere and anytime with any devices. However, before it becomes a reality, the problems of access control and authentication have to be solved, among others. Existing solutions are inadequate without adaptation to this specific environment. Among the promising approaches, the trust paradigm seems to be more flexible than others. We base this proposal on this paradigm to implement a distrust model, so-called APC (access pass certificate). The main objective of this model is to enable authorized user to roam and to access trusted hosts without being known locally. Each user can have an APC certificate from two kinds of hosts: the main host (where the user is member) and the trusted host (that trusts the user). Using these certificates, the user extends progressively his access scope. Moreover, this model implements a decentralized mapping policy, where correspondence between the user's home profile and its rights on the trusted hosts is determined as needed. This distrust model and its implementation are presented in this article where we exhibit its interests for large but controlled access in pervasive environments.",

In this paper, we develop network duality which is applicable to arbitrary multi-user MIMO networks with a generalized cost function. More importantly, we provide an optimization theoretic perspective of network duality which naturally leads to the construction of a dual network. We then consider the joint MIMO beamforming and power control problem with individual SINR constraints. We apply the network duality to this problem and propose a high performance algorithm which compared to past approaches has improved convergence behavior.",

Recently, the q-Gaussian distribution, which is derived in the non-extensive statistics, has been shown to be useful for representing patterns in many complex systems in physics such as fractals and cosmology. We propose q-Gaussian mixture models (q-GMMs), which are mixture models of q-Gaussian distributions, for image and video semantic indexing. It has a parameter q to control its tail-heaviness. The long-tailed distributions obtained for q>1 are expected to effectively represent complexly correlated data, and hence, to improve robustness against outliers. In our experiments, our proposed method outperformed the BoW method and achieved 49.4% and 10.9% in Mean Average Precision on the PASCAL VOC 2010 dataset and the TRECVID 2010 Semantic Indexing dataset, respectively.",

    "abstract": "Abstract   Underwater transients present an unusual but unique recognition problem in that pattern characteristics and categories are not well defined, and the patterns are highly nonstationary. This paper examines the characterization, segmentation and classification of the transient events. A comparison with speech processing and recognition is also made. Although it is difficult to fully characterize the transient data, it is shown that by extracting event portions of the transient waveform through segmentation, a low order autoregressive model can provide an effective feature set for cluster analysis and event classification. Both the segmentation procedure and the recognition experiments with real data are presented in detail.",

    "abstract": "During the last decade, the lattice-Boltzmann method (LBM) as a valuable tool in computational fluid dynamics has been increasingly acknowledged. The widespread application of LBM is partly due to the simplicity of its coding. The most well-known algorithms for the implementation of the standard lattice-Boltzmann equation (LBE) are the two-lattice and two-step algorithms. However, implementations of the two-lattice or the two-step algorithm suffer from high memory consumption or poor computational performance, respectively. Ultimately, the computing resources available decide which of the two disadvantages is more critical. Here we introduce a new algorithm, called the swap algorithm, for the implementation of LBE. Simulation results demonstrate that implementations based on the swap algorithm can achieve high computational performance and have very low memory consumption. Furthermore, we show how the performance of its implementations can be further improved by code optimization.",

    "abstract": "We introduce a semantic characterization of narrowing, the computational engine of many functional logic languages. We use a functional domain for giving a denotation to the narrowing space associated to a given initial expression under an arbitrary narrowing strategy. Such a semantic description highlights (and favours) the operational notion of evaluation instead of the more usual model-theoretic notion of interpretation as the basis for the semantic description. The motivation is to obtain an abstract semantics which encodes information about the real operational framework used by a given (narrowingbased) functional logic language. Our aim is to provide a semantic foundation for the development of a general, suitable, and accurate framework for the analysis of functional logic programs.",

    "abstract": "This paper introduces alloyed prediction, a new hardware-based two-level branch predictor organization that combines global and local history in the same structure, combining the advantages of current two-level predictors with those of hybrid predictors. The alloyed organization is motivated by measurements showing that wrong-history mispredictions are even more important than conflict-induced mispredictions. Wrong-history mispredictions arise because current two-level, history-based predictors provide only global or only local history. The contribution of wrong history to the overall misprediction rate is substantial because most programs have some branches that require global history and others that require local history. This paper explores several ways to implement alloyed prediction, including the previously proposed bi-mode organization. Simulations show that mshare is the best alloyed organization among those we examine, and that mshare gives reliably good prediction compared to bimodal (\"two-bit\"), two-level, and hybrid predictors. The robust performance of alloying across a range of predictor sizes stems from its ability to attack wrong-history mispredictions at even very small sizes without subdividing the branch prediction hardware into smaller and less effective components.",

Via the fuzzy modeling approach, the nonlinear stochastic system is described by Takagi-Sugeno (T-S) fuzzy model in which the consequent parts are presented by linear stochastic time-delay differential equation. With Lyapunov-Krasovskii function and improved Jensen's inequality, the stability criteria are derived. In addition, the passivity theory is employed to discuss external disturbance effect on system for achieving attenuation performance. According to the proposed design method, the fuzzy controller is carried out by parallel distributed compensation (PDC) concept to guarantee the robust asymptotical stability and attenuation performance of system in the sense of mean square. Finally, a synchronous generator power system is presented to manifest the application and effectiveness of the proposed fuzzy control method.",

    "abstract": "The authors demonstrate the need to address fault latency in highly reliable real-time control computer systems. It is noted that the effectiveness of all known recovery mechanisms is greatly reduced in the presence of multiple latent faults. The presence of multiple latent faults increases the possibility of multiple errors, which could result in coverage failure. The authors present experimental evidence indicating that the duration of fault latency is dependent on workload. A synthetic work generator is used to vary the workload, and a hardware fault injector is applied to inject transient faults of varying durations. This method makes it possible to derive the distribution of fault latency duration. Experimental results obtained from the fault-tolerant multiprocessor at the NASA Airlab are presented and discussed. >",

The nonlinear plant is represented by a Takagi-Sugeno (T-S) uncertain fuzzy model. The communication links between the plant and controller are assumed to be imperfect, that is, data packet dropouts occur intermittently, which is often the case in a network environment. Stochastic variables satisfying the Bernoulli random binary distribution are adopted to characterize the data missing phenomenon. Attention is focused on the design of a piecewise static output feedback controller such that the closed-loop system is stochastically stable with a guaranteed \u210b \u221e  performance. Based on a piecewise Lyapunnov function combined with some novel convexifying techniques, the developed theoretical results are in the form of linear matrix inequalities. Finally, a simulation example is also provided to illustrate the effectiveness and less conservatism of the proposed approaches.",

    "abstract": "To achieve good generalization in supervised learning, the training and testing examples are usually required to be drawn from the same source distribution. In this paper we propose a method to relax this requirement in the context of logistic regression. Assuming  D p   and  D a   are two sets of examples drawn from two mismatched distributions, where  D a   are fully labeled and  D p   partially labeled, our objective is to complete the labels of  D p .  We introduce an auxiliary variable \u03bc for each example in  D a   to reflect its mismatch with  D p .  Under an appropriate constraint the \u03bc's are estimated as a byproduct, along with the classifier. We also present an active learning approach for selecting the labeled examples in  D p .  The proposed algorithm, called \"Migratory-Logit\" or M-Logit, is demonstrated successfully on simulated as well as real data sets.",

    "abstract": "ABSTRACT#R##N##R##N#Nowadays, social network site (SNS) has been a popular platform for information sharing and dissemination. However, because of unknown information sources or unfamiliar recommenders, users of SNS may receive thousands of recommending information, which contain potential risks to receivers. To meet the challenge of confirming reliabilities of recommendations, a novel method of recommended trust computation is proposed in this paper. Firstly, according to the elements of users' relationships and community characteristics in SNS, concepts of belief and reputation are defined to express subjective trustable relationship among individuals and objective trust view. Then, recommended trust computation is presented on the basis of aforementioned two concepts. The recommended trust computation is divided into two aspects, that is, recommended trust computation with different route composition and recommendation optional confidence. Further, a SNS recommended trust computation framework is proposed. Finally, examinations are given to further explain the efficiency and feasibility of our mechanism.

    "abstract": "Spatial confidentiality concerns limit the sharing of data between health data guardians and other researchers. This reduces the contribution GIScience might play in understanding spatial patterns of poor health. This paper takes a first step towards easing data sharing by investigating the confidentiality risks in releasing aggregated data at a fine spatial resolution. A randomly generated cancer map is exported as a graduated color overlay to Google Earth and test subjects are asked to locate where they believe the disease cases reside. Risk is measured by both the separating distance and the number of alternate parcels between the \u201cchoice\u201d and a randomly generated disease case. The paper also develops a simulation approach that can be used to test the level of risk involved with these choices. Results suggest that across the scales of aggregation tested in this paper, the finest of which is a 0.5\u00a0km grid, there was relatively little risk in revealing sensitive information. In addition, the closest student choice to a disease case was not consistent across aggregations, suggesting no underlying geographic vulnerability. Although the results presented here are encouraging, a series of subsequent investigations are needed before data sharing guidelines can be proposed.",

    "abstract": "The primary goal of the Semantic Web is to use URIs as a universal space to name anything, expanding from using URIs for webpages to URIs for \"real objects and imaginary concepts,\" as phrased by Berners-Lee. This distinction has often been tied to the distinction between information resources, like webpages and multimedia files, and non-information resources, which are everything from real people to abstract concepts like `the integers.' Furthermore, the W3C has recommended not to use the same URI for information resources and non-information resources, and several communities like the Linked Data initiative are deploying this principle. The definition put forward by the W3C, that non-information resources are things whose \"essential nature is information\" is a difficult distinction at best. For example, would the text of Moby Dick be an information resource? While this problem could safely be ignored up until recently, with the rise of Linked Data and projects like OKKAM, it appears that this problem should be modelled formally. An ontology called IRW (Identity and Reference on the Web) of various types of resources and their relationships, both for the hypertext Web and the Semantic Web, is presented. It builds upon Information Object Lite (an extension of DOLCE Ultra Lite for describing information objects) and IRE (an earlier ontology of and aligns with other work in this area. This ontology can be used as a tool to make the Semantic Web more self-describing and to allow inference to be used to test for membership in various classes of resources.",

Araque et al. (Technical Report SOR-90-12, Princeton University, 1990) introduced several classes of facet-defining inequalities for the undirected version of the problem, most of which have straightforward analogs to the directed version and are also facet-defining in that case (see Zhang, Master's thesis, 1993). The multistar constraints are one such class. Gouveia [Telecommun Syst 1 (1993), 51\u201356] showed that a directed flow formulation gives a polynomial representation of the class of directed multistar constraints. This equivalence shows how to obtain a polynomial-time separation algorithm for this class of inequalities. In this paper, we show that the previous equivalence result implies that we can also separate in polynomial time the exponential-sized class of undirected multistar constraints. We also show that \u201cusing a directed model\u201d plays a key role in obtaining a polynomial-time separation algorithm for this class of inequalities, that is, using a directed flow model seems to be crucial for obtaining a polynomial-time separation algorithm for the class of undirected multistar constraints. \u00a9 2002 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.",

    "abstract": "Most research on P2P multimedia streaming assumes that users access video content sequentially and passively. Unlike P2P live streaming in which the peers start playback from the current point of streaming when they join the streaming session, in P2P video-on-demand streaming VCR-like operations such as forward, backward, and random-seek have to be supported. Providing this level of interactive streaming service in a P2P environment is a significant challenge. This paper proposes a balanced binary tree-based strategy for unstructured video-on- demand distribution in P2P networks (BBTU). BBTU assumes videos can be divided into several segments which can be fetched from different peers. BBTU involves two steps: 1) balance binary tree construction based on a prefetching algorithm in order to support interactivity; 2) unstructured video dissemination over network based on gossip protocol, which is the overlay for video distribution. Analysis and simulation show how BBTU is an efficient interactive streaming solution in P2P environment.",

    "abstract": "The visual nature of geometry applications makes it a natural area where visualization can be an effective tool for demonstrating algorithms. In this paper we propose a new model, called Mocha, for interactive visualization of algorithms over the World Wide Web. Mocha is a distributed model with a client-server architecture that optimally partitions the software components of a typical algorithm execution and visualization system, and leverages the power of the Java language, which has become the standard for distributing interactive platform-independent applications across the Web. Mocha provides high levels of security, protects the algorithm code, places a light communication load on the Internet, and allows users with limited computing resources to access executions of computationally expensive algorithms. The user interface combines fast responsiveness with the powerful authoring capabilities of hypertext narratives. We describe the architecture of Mocha, show its advantages over previous methods, and present a prototype that can be accessed by any user with a WWW browser supporting Java. The Mocha prototype has been widely accessed over the WWW, as demonstrated by the statistics that we have collected, and the Mocha model has been adopted by other research groups. Mocha is currently part of a broader system, called GeomNet, which performs distributed geometric computing over the Internet.",

A standard approach is keyframing, but adjusting the shape of the flexible body for each key frame is tedious. In addition, the character cannot dynamically adjust its motion to respond to the environment or user input. This paper introduces a new procedural deformation framework (ProcDef) for designing and driving animations of such flexible objects. Our approach is to synthesize global motions procedurally by integrating local deformations. ProcDef provides an efficient design scheme for local deformation patterns; the user can control the orientation and magnitude of local deformations as well as the propagation of deformation signals by specifying line charts and volumetric fields. We also present a fast and robust deformation algorithm based on shape-matching dynamics and show some example animations to illustrate the feasibility of our framework.",

    "abstract": "This article presents the mechanisms in Windows 2000 that enable fine-grained and centrally managed access control for both operating system components and applications. These features were added during the transition from Windows NT 4.0 to support the Active Directory, a new feature in Windows 2000, and to protect computers connected to the Internet. While the access control mechanisms in Windows NT are suitable for file systems and applications with simple requirements, they fall short of the needs of applications with complex data objects. Our goal was to use operating system access control mechanisms to protect a large object hierarchy with many types of objects, each with many data properties. We also wanted to reduce the exposure of users to untrustworthy or exploited programs.We introduced three extensions to support these goals. First, we extended the entries in access control lists to provide an unlimited number of access rights for a single object and to allow grouping those rights for efficiency. Second, we extended the entries to specify precisely how access control lists are assigned to each distinct type of object, instead of treating all types identically. Finally, we extended the data structure identifying users' identity to the operating system to allow users to restrict the set of objects a program may access. These changes allow a single access control mechanism to be used to protect both system and application resources, as well as protect users from each other and users from their programs, simplifying both program development and system management.",

    "abstract": "In interdisciplinary research scientists have to share and integrate knowledge between people and across disciplinary boundaries. An important issue for philosophy of science is to understand how scientists who work in these kinds of environments exchange knowledge and develop new concepts and theories across diverging fields. There is a substantial literature within social epistemology that discusses the social aspects of scientific knowledge, but so far few attempts have been made to apply these resources to the analysis of interdisciplinary science. Further, much of the existing work either ignores the issue of differences in background knowledge, or it focuses explicitly on conflicting background knowledge. In this paper we provide an analysis of the interplay between epistemic dependence between individual experts with different areas of expertise. We analyze the cooperative activity they engage in when participating in interdisciplinary research in a group, and we compare our findings with those of other studies in interdisciplinary research.",

In our RGA, a relation-oriented representation (or relational encoding) is adopted and corresponding genetic operators are redesigned. The relational encoding is represented by the equivalence relation matrix which has a 1-1 and onto correspondence with the class of all possible partitions. It eliminates the redundancy of previous GA representations and improves the performance of genetic search. The generalized problem-independent operators we redesigned manipulate the genes without requiring specific heuristics in the process of evolution. In addition, our RGA also supports a variable number of subsets. It works without requiring a fixed number of subsets in advance. Experiments for solving some well-known classic partitioning problems by RGA and GGA with and without heuristics are performed. Experimental results show that our RGA is significantly better than GGA in all cases with larger problem sizes.",

This paper presents a mechanism to find fair allocations of multiple divisible resources, which, contrary to other mechanisms, is applicable to but not limited to the example above. Wide applicability of the mechanism is achieved by designing it (1) to scale with the number of consumers and resources, (2) to allow for arbitrary preference functions of consumers, and (3) to not rely on monetary compensation. The mechanism uses a mathematical definition of greediness to balance resources consumers receive and thereby to compute a fair allocation.",

However, none of the existing algorithms has been proved to be backward stable, and they all have a significantly higher arithmetic cost than the standard algorithms currently used. We present new spectral divide and conquer algorithms for the symmetric eigenvalue problem and the singular value decomposition that are backward stable, achieve lower bounds on communication costs recently derived by Ballard, Demmel, Holtz, and Schwartz, and have operation counts within a small constant factor of those for the standard algorithms.

The methods which achieve the theoretically optimum solutions have generally iterative structures. That is why when limited computational load is required, suboptimum methods described by closed form formulas like the one of Coope which depends on orthogonal decomposition of sensor coordinates, are preferred. In this method, when there are more than necessary distance measurements required for localization, the location will be found as the arithmetic average of the estimates obtained using the all three-combinations of distance measurements. In the averaging, eliminating the outlier estimates will increase the performance. In this case discarding the estimates making the ratio of alpha which are farthest away from the arithmetic average, one attains the so called alpha-trimmed mean of the estimates. Applying this technique, the disturbing effects of impulsive mixture of Gaussian contamination are eliminated and similar performances as in the case of Gaussian distance measurements are attained in localization.",

    "abstract": "Abstract#R##N##R##N#The initial step of protein oxidation is studied through \u03b1-H abstraction by an OH radical with various secondary structure motifs of proteins. It is found that there exist preferential \u03b1-Hs in this kind of abstractions. The typical abstraction mechanism involves three steps: forming a pre-reactive complex before abstraction, the abstraction reaction, and the H2O detachment from a post-reactive complex to form the product, C\u03b1-center radical. Using the stability of the pre-reactive complex and the reaction barrier, we provide some explanation for this site preference. The feasibility of \u03b1-H abstraction by OH radical depends not only on the types of secondary structure, but also on the reaction condition, such as in aqueous or in gas phase. Moreover, the reactivity of the abstraction also depends on the location of \u03b1-H in the secondary structure motifs. The preferential \u03b1-Hs to be abstracted in \u03b2-sheet are those immediate to the amide or carbonyl group, and without involving hydrogen bonding, whereas in reverse turns, the preferential \u03b1-Hs are near the C-terminal of type I and near the N-terminal of type II. In general, the \u03b1-Hs in \u03b1-helix are more difficult to be abstracted than those in \u03b2-sheet and polypeptide in linear form. It is consistent with the trend of their bond dissociation energies. Our theoretical rate constant of N-acetyldiglycin-methylamide (Ac(Gly)2NHCH3) in aqueous solution (6.75 \u00d7 108 M\u22121 s\u22121) is close to the experimental observation of N-acetyldiglycinamide (Ac(Gly)2NH2) (8.6 \u00d7 108 M\u22121 s\u22121). \u00a9 2007 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

The core of our framework is the solution to the max-min signal-to-interference-plus-noise-ratio (SINR) problem for multiuser TWR. We solve this problem using a Dinkelbach-type algorithm with near-optimal performance and superlinear convergence. We show that, using the max-min SINR solution as a corner stone, the beamforming designs under various important criteria, such as weighted sum-rate maximization, weighted sum mean-square-error (MSE) minimization, and average bit-error-rate (BER) or symbol-error-rate (SER) minimization, etc, can be reformulated into a monotonic program. A polyblock outer approximation algorithm is then used to find the desired solutions with guaranteed convergence and optimal performance (provided that the core max-min SINR solver is optimal). Furthermore, the proposed unified approach can provide important insights for tackling the optimal beamforming designs in other emerging network models and settings. For instances, we extend the proposed framework to address the beamforming design in collaborative TWR and multi-pair MIMO TWR. Extensive numerical results are presented to demonstrate the merits of the proposed beamforming solutions.",

    "abstract": "In this paper, we formulate the problem of early classification of time series data, which is important in some time-sensitive applications such as health-informatics. We introduce a novel concept of MPL (Minimum Prediction Length) and develop ECTS (Early Classification on Time Series), an effective 1-nearest neighbor classification method. ECTS makes early predictions and at the same time retains the accuracy comparable to that of a 1NN classifier using the full-length time series. Our empirical study using benchmark time series data sets shows that ECTS works well on the real data sets where 1NN classification is effective.",

    "abstract": "The present paper studies repeated Bertrand oligopoly with multiple markets. The markets are subject to independent, stochastic fluctuations in demands. According to the literature, the demand fluctuations generally hinder collusion, while the multimarket contact sometimes facilitates it. We show that when only partial collusion is sustainable under a single market, the per-market expected profit under the most collusive equilibrium increases with the number of markets. Further, the difference between the total expected profit under full collusion and that under the most collusive equilibrium vanishes, if the number of markets goes to infinity. Thus the collusion-deterrence effects of fluctuated demands completely disappear in the limit. Copyright Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg 2015",

    "abstract": "A scalable e-commerce server should be able to provide different levels of quality of service (QoS) to different types of requests based on clients' navigation patterns and the server capacity. E-commerce workloads are composed of sessions. In this paper, we propose a session-based two-dimensional (2D) service differentiation model for online transactions: intersession and intrasession. The intersession model aims to provide different levels of QoS to sessions from different customer classes, and the intrasession model aims to provide different levels of QoS to requests in different states of a session. A primary performance metric of online transactions is slowdown. It measures the waiting time of a request relative to its service time. We present a processing rate allocation scheme for 2D proportional slowdown differentiation. We then introduce service slowdown as a systemwide QoS metric of an e-commerce server. It is defined as the weighted sum of request slowdown in different sessions and in different session states. We formulate the problem of 2D service differentiation as an optimization of processing rate allocation with the objective of minimizing the service slowdown of the server. We prove that the derived rate allocation scheme based on the optimization guarantees client requests' slowdown to be square-root proportional to their prespecified differentiation weights in both intersession and intrasession dimensions. We evaluate this square-root proportional rate allocation scheme and a proportional rate allocation scheme via extensive simulations. Results validate that both schemes can achieve predictable, controllable, and fair 2D service differentiation on e-commerce servers. The square-root proportional rate allocation scheme provides 2D service differentiation at a minimum cost of service slowdown",

    "abstract": "Abstract   This paper relates to a face recognition and verification technique based on ridgelet transforms. Our proposed method first uses the ridgelet transform of the face image for feature extraction. This involves first applying a sequen- tial combination of radon and wavelet transforms to both the training and test images. The result is then decomposed into a set of feature vectors. The Euclidean distance between training and test feature vectors is finally used for the actual recognition. Before applying any transform on the training image, we normalize the image using a segmentation process based on the YCbCr colour model. This essentially detects the largest region of skin in the image. Experimental results using Yale, AT&T, faces94, faces96 and Indian databases show the superiority of the proposed method with some of the existing popular algorithms.",

    "abstract": "We propose a new learning algorithm for locally recurrent neural networks, called truncated recursive backpropagation which can be easily implemented on-line with good performance. Moreover it generalises the algorithm proposed by Waibel et al. (1989) for TDNN, and includes the Back and Tsoi (1991) algorithm as well as BPS and standard on-line backpropagation as particular cases. The proposed algorithm has a memory and computational complexity that can be adjusted by a careful choice of two parameters h and h' and so it is more flexible than a previous algorithm proposed by us. Although for the sake of brevity we present the new algorithm only for IIR-MLP networks, it can be applied also to any locally recurrent neural network. Some computer simulations of dynamical system identification tests, reported in literature, are also presented to assess the performance of the proposed algorithm applied to the IIR-MLP.",

This investigation establishes an analytical hierarchy framework to help SMEs predicting implementation success as well as identifying the actions necessary before implementing B2B e-commerce to increase e-commerce initiative feasibility. The consistent fuzzy preference relation is used to improve decision-making consistency and effectiveness. A case study involving six influences solicited from a Taiwanese steel company is used to illustrate the feasibility and effectiveness of the proposed approach. The analytical results show that the three most influential factors are management support, industry characteristics and government policies; meanwhile, the three least influential factors are organizational culture, IT integration and firm size.",

    "abstract": "In this paper, an innovative knowledge-based methodological framework to detect sleep slow waves (SSW) in the human sleep electroencephalogram (EEG) is proposed. Based on a restricted matching pursuit (RMP) algorithm, automatic pattern recognition of SSW is implemented using a small dictionary of Gabor functions modeling the target waveform morphological characteristics. The method describes EEG signals in terms of SSW properties and provides detection thresholds based on the largest MP coefficients. A computer software implementation of this new method was tested on a database of overnight polysomnographic recordings collected in 15 young healthy subjects and visually scored by a trained sleep expert. In addition to full automation and fast application, the results obtained from the RMP algorithm, and evaluated using a rigorous performance evaluation metrics, showed excellent agreement as compared with expert scoring, with 97% of correct detections and a concordance of 67% in SSW time position and duration. The performances demonstrated by this new method were superior to that of a canonical detection algorithm introduced earlier, with an equivalent sensitivity but a significant 12% increase in precision ( p  = 0.0002). By mimicking the way human processes information while scoring SSW, the RMP algorithm proves stable over time and sleep/wake states, and may thus be used with virtually no human intervention.",

    "abstract": "article Brain Causality Inference Neuroscience Time series For decades, the main ways to study the effect of one part of the nervous system upon another have been either to stimulate or lesion the first part and investigate the outcome in the second. This article describes a fundamentally different approach to identifying causal connectivity in neuroscience: a focus on the predictability of ongoing activity in one part from that in another. This approach was made possible by a new method that comes from the pioneering work of Wiener (1956) and Granger (1969). The Wiener-Granger method, unlike stimulation and ablation, does not require direct intervention in the nervous system. Rather, it relies on the estimation of causal statistical influences between simultaneously recorded neural time series data, either in the absence of identifiable behavioral events or in the context of task performance. Causality in the Wiener-Granger sense is based on the statistical predictability of one time series that derives from knowledge of one or more others. This article defines Wiener-Granger Causality, discusses its merits and limitations in neuroscience, and outlines recent developments in its implementation.",

Another choice is to perform a structural transformation of the representation of the problem, so that the resulting problem is a binary CSP except that now the original constraints which were nonbinary are replaced by binary compatibility constraints between relations. A lot of recent work has focussed on comparing different levels of local consistency enforceable in the nonbinary representation with the dual representation. In this paper we present extensions to the standard dual encoding that can compactly represent the given CSP using an equivalent dual encoding that contains all the original solutions to the CSP, using constraint coverings. We show how enforcing arc consistency in these constraint covering based encodings, strictly dominates enforcement of generalized arc consistency (GAC) on the primal nonbinary encoding.",

    "abstract": "World Wide Web search engines including Google, Yahoo and MSN have become the most heavily-used online services (including the targeted advertising), with millions of searches performed each day on unstructured sites. In this presentation, we would like to go beyond the traditional web search engines that are based on keyword search and the Semantic Web which provides a common framework that allows data to be shared and reused across application. For this reason, our view is that \"Before one can use the power of web search the relevant information has to be mined through the concept-based search mechanism and logical reasoning with capability to Q&A representation rather than simple keyword search\". In this paper, we will first present the state of the search engines. Then we will focus on development of a framework for reasoning and deduction in the web. A new web search model will be presented. One of the main core ideas that we will use to extend our technique is to change terms-documents-concepts (TDC) matrix into a rule-based and graph-based representation. This will allow us to evolve the traditional search engine (keyword-based search) into a concept-based search and then into Q&A model. Given TDC, we will transform each document into a rule-based model including it's equivalent graph model. Once the TDC matrix has been transformed into maximally compact concept based on graph representation and rules based on possibilistic relational universal fuzzy-type II (pertaining to composition), one can use Z(n)-compact algorithm and transform the TDC into a decision-tree and hierarchical graph that will represents a Q&A model. Finally, the concept of semantic equivalence and semantic entailment based on possibilistic relational universal fuzzy will be used as a basis for question-answering (Q&A) and inference from fuzzy premises. This will provide a foundation for approximate reasoning, language for representation of imprecise knowledge, a meaning representation language for natural languages, precisiation of fuzzy propositions expressed in a natural language, and as a tool for Precisiated Natural Language (PNL) and precisation of meaning. The maximally compact documents based on Z(n)-compact algorithm and possibilistic relational universal fuzzy-type II will be used to cluster the documents based on concept-based query-based search criteria.",

Designed in a 130-nm triple-well complementary metal-oxide-semiconductor process with regular  VT  transistors, the amplifier achieves a simulated performance of 51-dB DC open-loop gain, 112-MHz unity gain bandwidth, and 67deg phase margin with a load of 6.5 pF/19.6 kOmega , and consumes 600 muW at 0.5-V supply. The proposed amplifier is incorporated in a continuous-time complex delta-sigma modulator with a 1-MHz signal bandwidth and 64times oversampling ratio.

Our goal is to analyze the performance of the CHC algorithm when solving realistic NP-hard combinatorial problems and test whether its previously reported high performance on similar problems also holds on this one. We perform a preliminary study to obtain a suitable configuration of the parameters in the algorithm. After choosing the configuration, we show the results for the problem instances in the benchmark. To give a reference on how CHC performs and scales, its results are compared against those of a GA. We conclude that CHC outperforms GA in large problem instances. Moreover, CHC produces promising results for the software project scheduling problem domain, and could be used by practitioners.",

    "abstract": "Link failures in wide area networks are common. To recover from such failures, a number of methods such as SONET rings, protection cycles, and source rerouting have been investigated. Two important considerations in such approaches are the recovery time and the needed spare capacity to complete the recovery. Usually, these techniques attempt to achieve a recovery time less than 50 ms. In this paper we introduce an approach that provides link failure recovery in a hitless manner, or without any appreciable delay. This is achieved by means of a method called diversity coding. We present an algorithm for the design of an overlay network to achieve recovery from single link failures in arbitrary networks via diversity coding. This algorithm is designed to minimize spare capacity for recovery. We compare the recovery time and spare capacity performance of this algorithm against conventional techniques in terms of recovery time, spare capacity, and a joint metric called Quality of Recovery (QoR). QoR incorporates both the spare capacity percentages and worst case recovery times. Based on these results, we conclude that the proposed technique provides much shorter recovery times while achieving similar extra capacity, or better QoR performance overall.",

The method is based on auditory listening-only tests, but the resulting impairment factors may be used for predicting speech quality in an instrumental way, e.g., for network planning purposes. Following the method, auditory test results are first transformed to an overall quality rating scale, and then adjusted to rule out test-specific effects. The derived impairment factors fit into the common framework which is defined by the E-model for narrow-band telephone networks, and which is hereby extended towards wide-band speech transmission. This paper presents the necessary auditory test data, describes the derivation and adjustment methodology, and provides numerical values for a range of wide-band speech codecs. The values are tested for their robustness in case of codec tandems and adjusted to represent the effects of packet loss",

    "abstract": "Segmenting the right ventricle (RV) in magnetic resonance (MR) images is required for cardiac function assessment. The segmentation of the RV is a difficult task due to low contrast with surrounding tissues and high shape variability. To overcome these problems, we introduce a segmentation method based on a statistical shape model obtained with a principal component analysis (PCA) on a set of representative shapes of the RV. Shapes are not represented by a set of points, but by distance maps to their contour, relaxing the need for a costly landmark detection and matching process. A shape model is thus obtained by computing a PCA on the shape variations. This prior is registered onto the image via a very simple user interaction and then incorporated into the well-known graph cut framework in order to guide the segmentation. Our semi-automatic segmentation method has been applied on 248 MR images of a publicly available dataset (from MICCAI'12 Right Ventricle Segmentation Challenge). We show that encouraging results can be obtained for this challenging application.",

    "abstract": "In this paper, we discuss TCP congestion control in the future heterogeneous mobile Internet where various access links such as a wireless LAN and a cellular network are integrated. Vertical handover (VH), which is a handover technique between different types of access links, is one of the most important technologies. However, the vertical handover significantly degrades the performance of TCP because it causes a drastic change of the bandwidth-delay product (BDP). In this paper, we propose a new congestion control for improving TCP performance during vertical handover. The proposed system is receiver driven and the TCP receiver controls the sending rate by ACK pacing. With computer simulation, we have shown that the proposed system adjust its congestion window size to a target BDP value rapidly and can achieve a good throughput performance.",

    "abstract": "This paper addresses the group activity recognition in the still image. We formulate an alternative discriminant contextual model on feature level. On the one hand, it mines the person-joint-context fea- ture model, which describes the interaction of a focal person and its sur- rounding context. In the meanwhile, the surrounding context is featured with the relative pose, relative location and the scene background. On the other hand, a similar interaction model is formed to learn the interac- tive correlation between a focal person and its surrounding context. An optimization criterion is proposed to learn the similar interaction model. We show that the optimization problem can be optimized efficiently. Our experimental results show that the proposed model outperforms related works, even though temporal information is not available.",

    "abstract": "The purpose of this paper is to investigate the significance of different coupling mechanisms that occur in a high precision D/A converter. The standard Integrated Circuit Emission Model approach is applied to an existing D/A converter built in TSMC CMOS 0.25 mum technology. Aggressors, propagation media and victims are defined and modelled using classical CAD tools. Potential noise sources and victims are identified and some frequency and time domain simulation results reveal the noise source signatures. This study highlights the main noise source in such kind of converters: the charging/discharging switch current that occur at each sampling period. Based on detailed simulations, the 60 mV peak to peak voltage glitch observed on the output is explained by power and ground ringing due to current switches, whereas previous studies suggested that such glitches were due to substrate coupling. The simulated substrate propagated digital glitches have a peak to peak voltage of 5 mV, and are more than ten times lower than glitches induced by the current switch activities.",

    "abstract": "Multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) wireless communication systems can offer high data rates through spatial multiplexing or substantial diversity using transmit diversity. In this letter, switching between spatial multiplexing and transmit diversity is proposed as a simple way to improve the diversity performance of spatial multiplexing. In the proposed approach, for a fixed rate, either multiplexing or diversity is chosen based on the instantaneous channel state and the decision is conveyed to the transmitter via a low-rate feedback channel. The minimum Euclidean distance at the receiver is computed for spatial multiplexing and transmit diversity and is used to derive the selection criterion. Additionally, the Demmel condition number of the matrix channel is shown to provide a sufficient condition for multiplexing to outperform diversity. Monte Carlo simulations demonstrate improvement over either multiplexing or diversity individually in terms of bit error rate.",

    "abstract": "Nowadays, several commercial and academic studies are available to measure and monitor health level of people. However, most of these applications have encountered many challenges to be used pervasively. In this paper, we have examined some of the practical challenges in developing and using health-monitoring systems through designing, developing and evaluating a simple wearable mobile system for kids. The project started with a survey among parents to understand user requirements, also we interviewed a doctor as a domain expert, and finally a wearable prototype of the system was developed and evaluated. Our finding shows that while putting the sensors on the most appropriate places of the body increases quality of physiological measurements, it would lead to decrease acceptability of these devices for children, e.x. children do not accept to put a temperature sensor in their ear for a long time. In this project, we have built an acceptable device for kids, but at the same time we have used data analysis methods such as removing outliers, smoothing data and using domain experts' knowledge to improve reliability of the system results.",

    "abstract": "Along with the rapid development of online gaming worldwide, online games have become the very successful and outstanding industry in recent years, especially in Massive Multiplayer Online Role-Playing Games (MMORPGs). Cyber-criminal activity arising from online games is increasing at an alarming rate. Further, online gaming crimes have turned out the most serious cybercrime in many countries, such as Taiwan, South Korea, China, Hong Kong, and so on. According to our analysis of online gaming characteristics in Taiwan from the year of 2002 to 2004, the majority of online gaming crime is theft and fraud, but fraud gets higher from 20% to 36%. Identity theft and social engineering are the major criminal means. The offenders are mainly male and always proceed alone. The age of offenders is low (average over 60% in the age range of 15-25). The offenders are mostly students, workers and the unemployed, most of them not having criminal records. The type of game giving rise to most of the criminal cases is still Lineage Online, but other games are getting higher from 0.8% to 28.4%. The value of the online gaming loss over $1500 U.S. dollars is getting higher from 3.8% to 9.9%. In this paper, we present an empirical analysis of online gaming criminal activity from the year of 2002 to 2004 in Taiwan and suggest ways to combat the criminal activity.",

This approach can process MRI data that comes from different scanners with different sequences and head coils, using several different spin-echo images (with different echo times) and different slice thickness. The system adapts without manual intervention. Segmented synthetic image data from the brainWeb simulated normal brain database resulted in a one voxel away accuracy of 90%.

    "abstract": "As a significant complement for skin surface images, skin biopsy image may reveal causes and severity of many skin diseases, especially in the case of skin cancer inspection. With rapid increment of skin disease patients, computational methods have been introduced for automatic classification of skin images. However, due to the complex relationship among annotation terms and features of local regions, it becomes a great challenge for skin biopsy image feature recognition and annotation. In this paper, we attempt to model the potential knowledge and experience of doctors on skin biopsy image annotation by using a recent proposed machine learning model, named multi-instance multi-label (MIML) model. We show that the relationship among annotation terms and skin biopsy images is naturally consistent with the MIML framework. We further propose a sparse Bayesian MIML algorithm which can produce a probability indicating the confidence of annotating a term. The proposed algorithm framework is evaluated on a real dataset from a large local hospital containing 12,700 skin biopsy images. The results show that the proposed algorithm is effective and prominent.",

The main enabling technology is the use of a streaming-based framework for connected component discovery. Moreover, our system employs an adaptive, online, iconic image clustering approach based on an augmented bag-of-words representation, in order to balance the goals of registration, comprehensiveness, and data compactness. We demonstrate our proposal by operating on a recent publicly available 100 million image crowd-sourced photo collection containing images geographically distributed throughout the entire world. Results illustrate that our streaming-based approach does not compromise model completeness, but achieves unprecedented levels of efficiency and scalability.",

Spectral bands for resolving solar-stimulated chlorophyll fluorescence and a split window in the 4-/spl mu/m region for SST will result in important new global ocean science products for biology and physics. MODIS will return full global data at 1-km resolution. The complete suite of Levels 2 and 3 ocean products is reviewed, and many areas where MODIS data are expected to make significant, new contributions to the enhanced understanding of the oceans' role in understanding climate change are discussed.

At the same time, research in geography has focused more and more on technology-mediated interaction with spatiotemporal phenomena. Despite the growing popularity of this geographic human-computer interaction (GeoHCI) in both fields, there have been few opportunities for GeoHCI knowledge sharing, knowledge creation or community building in either discipline, let alone between them. The goal of this workshop is thus two-fold. First, we will seek to sum up the state of GeoHCI knowledge and address GeoHCI core issues by inviting prominent researchers in the space to share and discuss the most important high-level findings from their work. Second, through our interdisciplinary organizing committee, we will recruit participants from both fields, with the goal of laying the groundwork for a community that works across intra- and interdisciplinary boundaries.",

Contrary to this view, we show that complex genetic evolution may occur within simple CA. The evolving self-replicating loops (\u201cevoloops\u201d) we investigate exhibit significant diversity in macro-scale morphologies and mutational biases, undergoing nontrivial genetic adaptation by maximizing colony density and enhancing sustainability against other species. Nonmutable subsequences enable genetic operations that alter fitness differentials and promote long-term evolutionary exploration.

    "abstract": "With the development of digital music technologies, it is an interesting and useful issue to recommend the 'favored music' from large amounts of digital music. Some Web-based music stores can recommend popular music which has been rated by many people. However, three problems that need to be resolved in the current methods are: (a) how to recommend the 'favored music' which has not been rated by anyone, (b) how to avoid repeatedly recommending the 'disfavored music' for users, and (c) how to recommend more interesting music for users besides the ones users have been used to listen. To achieve these goals, we proposed a novel method called personalized hybrid music recommendation, which combines the content-based, collaboration-based and emotion-based methods by computing the weights of the methods according to users' interests. Furthermore, to evaluate the recommendation accuracy, we constructed a system that can recommend the music to users after mining users' logs on music listening records. By the feedback of the user's options, the proposed methods accommodate the variations of the users' musical interests and then promptly recommend the favored and more interesting music via consecutive recommendations. Experimental results show that the recommendation accuracy achieved by our method is as good as 90%. Hence, it is helpful for recommending the 'favored music' to users, provided that each music object is annotated with the related music emotions. The framework in this paper could serve as a useful basis for studies on music recommendation.",

    "abstract": "Theoretical treatments forecast that bistable CMOS devices using electronic charge as a state variable will operate at their maximum thermal dissipation limit possibly as early as 2012. The problem is further compounded by increasing manufacturing challenges associated with the ever decreasing logic switch dimensions. These challenges require the development of new fabrication strategies that replace or complement current top-down lithography with bottom-up protocols using controlled self-assembly of nanomaterial building blocks. To answer some of these issues, this paper focuses on a new device paradigm consisting of an arene-metal-arene conformational switch, addressable through capacitive, inductive, or resonant-tunneling field coupling. The operating principle is based on voltage-tunable modulation in quantum electron transmission. The switch is open (off) when the metal ion is displaced to a position at a C-H bond on the arene ring due to an externally applied bias. Conversely, when the external bias is removed, the metal ion moves to an axis- symmetric position on the arene ring, and the switch is closed (on). The paper presents a summary of the architecture, operating principle, and advantages of the conformational switch, along with associated findings from proof-of-concept theoretical and experimental studies of its target specifications and performance. The paper also discusses opportunities and challenges related to the integration of conformational switches into hybrid CMOS-molecular and monolithic (all molecular) circuits.",

These approaches were built to fit on a multi-agent system with specialist agents solving disruptions. A comparative analysis of the algorithms is also presented.

    "abstract": "In Machine Learning (ML) and Evolutionary Computation (EC), it is often beneficial to approximate a complicated function by a simpler one, such as a linear or quadratic function, for computational efficiency or feasibility reasons (cf. [Jin, 2005]). A complicated function (the target function in ML or the fitness function in EC) may require an exponential amount of computation to learn/evaluate, and thus approximations by simpler functions are needed. We consider the problem of approximating pseudo-Boolean functions by simpler (e.g., linear) functions when the instance space is associated with a probability distribution. We consider {0, 1}n as a sample space with a (possibly nonuniform) probability measure on it, thus making pseudo-Boolean functions into random variables. This is also in the spirit of the PAC learning framework of Valiant [Valiant, 1984] where the instance space has a probability distribution on it. The best approximation to a target function f is then defined as the function g (from all possible approximating functions of the simpler form) that minimizes the expected distance to f. In an example, we use methods from linear algebra to find, in this more general setting, the best approximation to a given pseudo-Boolean function by a linear function.",

    "abstract": "IEEE 802.16j standard defines Relay Station (RS) to enhance network throughput. Deploying RSs within the serving area of the Base Station (BS) could increase network throughput but raise the hardware cost problem. This paper presents a deployment algorithm for IEEE 802.16j network. According to the history traffic of internet usage, the proposed algorithm deploys as few as possible RSs at suitable locations such that the traffic requirement of each subarea can be satisfied. The proposed relay deployment algorithm mainly consists of three phases. The first phase aims to construct several promising zones where a RS deployed in each zone can improve the transmission rate from mobile station to BS. The second phase further combines several zones into a bigger one aiming at reducing the number of deployed RSs. The last phase selects the relay zones from the promising zones and deploys one RS in each relay zone. Simulation results show that our proposed algorithm can deploy the RSs at the most appropriate locations and hence efficiently reduce transmission delay and save the hardware cost.",

    "abstract": "Nonlinear modeling of multi-input multi-output (MIMO) neuronal systems using Principal Dynamic Modes (PDMs) provides a novel method for analyzing the functional connectivity between neuronal groups. This paper presents the PDM-based modeling methodology and initial results from actual multi-unit recordings in the prefrontal cortex of non-human primates. We used the PDMs to analyze the dynamic transformations of spike train activity from Layer 2 (input) to Layer 5 (output) of the prefrontal cortex in primates performing a Delayed-Match-to-Sample task. The PDM-based models reduce the complexity of representing large-scale neural MIMO systems that involve large numbers of neurons, and also offer the prospect of improved biological/physiological interpretation of the obtained models. PDM analysis of neuronal connectivity in this system revealed \"input---output channels of communication\" corresponding to specific bands of neural rhythms that quantify the relative importance of these frequency-specific PDMs across a variety of different tasks. We found that behavioral performance during the Delayed-Match-to-Sample task (correct vs. incorrect outcome) was associated with differential activation of frequency-specific PDMs in the prefrontal cortex.",

    "abstract": "The existing cellular and specialised mobile radio (SMR) systems are well positioned to provide service to new cellular and cellular-like customers over the next decade, and analog AMPS is likely to be attractive to support roaming for a number of years. Multitier wireless access and multimode terminals are likely to emerge to support wireless access that is optimized for different types of venues. The allocation of 120 MHz of licensed spectrum for PCS at 2 GHz is likely to encourage the deployment of new wireless technologies such as widespread low-power wireless access, as well as cellular-like technology, to provide new services and permit service differentiation to develop new markets. Satellite-based PCS for remote areas will also emerge. Interoperability of handsets and wireless data terminals with radio ports using both licensed and unlicensed PCS spectrum is likely to be desirable to provide maximum connectivity and optimized service. The FCC's rules for unlicensed PCS operation substantially favor TDMA/TDD operation. >",

The robotic arm is driven by gravitational and inertia forces of the counterweight mounted on links. The joints of the robotic arms are able to rotate freely though this robot does not have any actuators on joints. Thereby, the robot has high joint flexibility. Additionally, the counterweight system reduces the moment applied to base link caused by gravity effect since the posture of the arm keeps a gravitational equilibrium state statically. Therefore, it is expected that the robotic arm is utilized in narrow and high altitude environment or on small vehicles. This paper also proposes a control method of the new robotic arm. The control method realizes precise position control of joint angle. The usefulness of the method is demonstrated by numerical simulations and experiments using a prototype.",

Here, a wide-sense stationary sum-of-sinusoids simulator design is presented and its stochastic behaviour is analyzed. Analytical expressions for the envelope and phase probability density functions and the simulator output signal autocorrelation function are given. These are used to obtain some design rules that relate the quality of the simulator output to the number of low-frequency oscillators, or equivalently sinusoids, used in the simulator. Our results contradict a common belief that the quality of the simulator output is related to the total number of multipath components. Rather, the quality is shown to depend on the number of distinct Doppler frequency shifts and it cannot be improved by using more multipath components that do not represent distinct Doppler frequency shifts.",

In these real-world problems the considered risk measure is frequently built on empirical distributions. It is therefore of interest to understand the potential deviation, which occurs when evaluating a risk measure for a perturbed, or slightly changed, probability measure. This paper addresses the potential deviation. It turns out that the Wasserstein distance, a well-known distance for probability measures, provides a valuable notion of distance in the present context: Many risk measures allow a precise quantification in terms of the Wasserstein distance, and important risk measures are continuous with respect to this distance. For specific random variables, which often occur in concrete, real-world problems, it is moreover demonstrated that the derived constants, describing the continuity properties, cannot be improved.

In object recognition, contours and colors are of great importance. Local contour parts and color combinations need to be found that safely assign the objects to their classes. Here, discrete object contours are analyzed. Significant contour parts, i.e., feature groups, that are very different or closely resemble each other, are detected. Also, global similarity based on local similarities is derived and the quality of the obtained significant contour parts is assessed with standard cluster analysis methods.

However, the inversion problem giving the value of the desired variable from the measured electromagnetic quantities (the image data) can be very complex and the nonlinear relationships involved need to be handled by suitable algorithms. In this paper a complete processing scheme providing quantities of interest for precision viticulture from data provided by WorldView-2 (WV2) and COSMOSkyMed (CSK) space platforms is presented. Once the appropriate season time was selected, the satellite data have been acquired over the test area within a limited time window and concurrently with the collection of the groundtruth. The workflow, besides adequate pre-processing steps, includes two neural networks (NN) modules, one is dedicated to the extraction of a restricted number of nonlinear components from the WV2 data, the other one to the actual inversion problem.

    "abstract": "Abstract   An object-oriented analysis-synthesis coder is presented which encodes arbitrarily shaped objects instead of rectangular blocks. The objects are described by three parameter sets defining their motion, shape and colour. Throughout this contribution, the colour parameters denote the luminance and chrominance values of the object surface. The parameter sets of each object are obtained by image analysis based on source models of moving 2D-objects and coded by an object-dependent parameter coding. Using the coded parameter sets an image can be reconstructed by model-based image synthesis. In order to cut down the generated bit-rate of the parameter coding, the colour updating of an object is suppressed if the modelling of the object by the source model is sufficiently exact, i.e., if only a relatively small colour update information would be needed for an errorless image synthesis. Omitting colour update information, small position errors of objects denoted as geometrical distortions are allowed for image synthesis instead of quantization error distortions. Tolerating geometrical distortions, the image area to be updated by colour coding can be decreased to 4% of the image size without introducing annoying distortions. As motion and shape parameters can efficiently be coded, about 1 bit per pel remains for colour updating in a 64 kbit/s coder compared to about 0.1 bit per pel in the standard reference coder (RM8) of the CCITT. Experimental results concerning the efficient coding of motion and shape parameters are given and discussed. The coding of the colour information will be dealt with in further research.",

The proposed method has the advantage of providing a robust bibliographic matching function using the statistical description of the syntax of bibliographic strings, a language model and an Optical Character Recognition (OCR) error model. The method also has the advantage of reducing the cost of preparing training data for parameter estimation, using records in the bibliographic database.",

    "abstract": "The service-oriented architecture (SOA) has been successfully applied in enterprise environments. Due to decentralized set-ups, mergers and acquisitions and organizational boundaries, many enterprises today operate multiple, fragmented and heterogeneous service infrastructures that are administered by different organizational units. This fragmented infrastructure causes service duplication and unnecessary redundancy. This paper proposes an approach of cross-domain service integration through an automated federation of Enterprise Service Buses (ESBs). ESBs are the mediation centers within a service domain that enable service interaction across technological boundaries by using service proxies. We present DISCE, a configuration engine prototype that enables an operator to configure service connectivity in such an environment in a declarative form, by specifying simple rules. The engine produces a configuration consisting of a set of proxies interconnecting clients and services.",

    "abstract": "This paper describes the dynamics and intermittent impact model of a novel rimless wheel with radially expanding spokes confined to move in a vertical plane. The wheel has two degrees of freedom, namely rotation in the plane and change of radius. The system has intermittent impacts with the ground and its mathematical model is discontinuous. The motions of the wheel on a horizontal and an inclined plane are investigated. The contact point of the wheel with the ground is assumed to have no slip. We derive the equations of motion in between the collisions and velocity change before and after the wheel impact. We construct the return map of its cyclic motion and plan the motion in between impacts to obtain a stable gait. Dynamic simulations are performed using MATLAB and are presented in the paper.",

    "abstract": "Abstract   Agents may contract some of their tasks to other agents even when they do not share a common goal. An agent may try to contract some of the tasks that it cannot perform by itself, or that may be performed more efficiently by other agents. One self-motivated agent may convince another self-motivated agent to help it with its task, by promises of rewards, even if the agents are not assumed to be benevolent. We propose techniques that provide efficient ways for agents to make incentive contracts in varied situations: when agents have full information about the environment and each other, or when agents do not know the exact state of the world. We consider situations of repeated encounters, cases of asymmetric information, situations where the agents lack information about each other, and cases where an agent subcontracts a task to a group of agents. Situations in which there is competition among possible contractor agents or possible manager agents are also considered. In all situations we assume that the contractor can choose a level of effort when carrying out the task and we would like the contractor to carry out the task efficiently without the need of close observation by the manager.",

    "abstract": "In the quest for tractable formal methods to improve the practice of software engineering, both CafeOBJ (7) and PAT 1 (12) have made great achievements based on different formal techniques. CafeOBJ has an evident advantage in specifying concurrent systems with object- oriented methods and proving behavioral properties based on reusability of proof. However, it is difficult to be applied to automatically verify some LTL based properties which involve complex state updates and finite path of states. Conversely, PAT offers great flexibility to simulate system behaviors and support modeling checking various properties, but it is difficult to prove behavioral properties directly, the definition of which is based on the structure of contexts. In the paper, we attempt to combine the two approaches by modeling specifications and verifying properties in CafeOBJ and PAT. A keyless car system is provided to illustrate our approach.",

Two V-beam electrothermal actuators are used to actuate an active gripping arm along two orthogonal directions and compress or shear a micro-sample grasped between the gripping tips, and two tri-plate differential capacitive sensors are employed for quantifying the compressive and shear forces applied to the sample with nanonewton resolutions (compressive force resolution: 7.7 nN and shear force resolution: 57.5 nN). Using the microgripper, we demonstrate, for the first time, on-chip compressive and shear testing of polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) micro-structures prepared at different mixing ratios. This device will be useful for accurately characterizing compressive and shear properties of a variety of microscale soft materials.",

    "abstract": "A canal surface in R3, generated by a parametrized curveC=m(t), is the Zariski closure of the envelope of the set of spheres with radius r(t) centered at m(t). This concept is a generalization of the classical notion of an offsets of a plane curve: first, the canal surface is a surface in 3-space rather than a curve inR2 and second, the radius function r(t) is allowed to vary with the parametert . In case r(t) =const, the resulting envelope is called a pipe surface. In this paper we develop an elementary symbolic method for generating rational parametrizations of canal surfaces generated by rational curves m(t) with rational radius variation r(t). This method leads to the problem of decomposing a polynomial into a sum of two squares over R. We discuss decomposition algorithms which give symbolic and numerical answers to this problem.",

There are two issues in time series motifs discovery, the deficiency of the definition of K-motifs given by Lin et al. (2002) and the large computation time for extracting motifs. In this paper, we propose a relatively comprehensive definition of K-motifs to obtain more valuable motifs. To minimize the computation time as much as possible, we extend the triangular inequality pruning method to avoid unnecessary operations and calculations, and propose an optimized matrix structure to produce the candidate motifs almost immediately. Results of two experiments on three time series datasets show that our motifs discovery algorithm is feasible and efficient.",

Unfortunately, only a limited number of acquired datasets are available and the scope of possible applications is limited by the patient's posture. In this paper, we propose an extension of the interactive cage-based deformation pipeline VoxMorph [1], for labeled voxel grids allowing to efficiently explore the space of plausible poses while preserving the tissues' internal structure. We propose 3 main contributions to overcome the limitations of this pipeline: (i) we improve its robustness by proposing a deformation diffusion scheme, (ii) we improve its accuracy by proposing a new error-metric for the refinement process of the motion adaptive structure, (iii) we improve its scalability by proposing an out-of-core implementation. Our method is easy to use for novice users, robust and scales up to 3D images that do not fit in memory, while offering limited distortion and mass loss. We evaluate our approach on postured whole-body segmented images and present an electro-magnetic wave exposure study for human-waves interaction simulations.",

    "abstract": "Consolidation of workloads has emerged as a key mechanism to dampen the rapidly growing energy expenditure within enterprise-scale data centers. To gainfully utilize consolidation-based techniques, we must be able to characterize the power consumption of groups of co-located applications. Such characterization is crucial for effective prediction and enforcement of appropriate limits on power consumption-power budgets-within the data center. We identify two kinds of power budgets (i) an average budget to capture an upper bound on long-term energy consumption within that level and (ii) a sustained budget to capture any restrictions on sustained draw of current above a certain threshold. Using a simple measurement infrastructure, we derive power profiles-statistical descriptions of the power consumption of applications. Based on insights gained from detailed profiling of several applications both individual and consolidated-we develop models for predicting average and sustained power consumption of consolidated applications. We conduct an experimental evaluation of our techniques on a Xen-based server that consolidates applications drawn from a diverse pool. For a variety of consolidation scenarios, We are able to predict average power consumption within 5% error margin and sustained power within 10% error margin. Our sustained power prediction techniques allow us to predict close yet safe upper bounds on the sustained power consumption of consolidated applications.",

A trivial software-based implementation incurs high computational cost and requires high operation frequency. In order to achieve realtime processing and efficient bus interface design for our target system, the load of an embedded processor is reduced through the use of specific hardware for a functional block that has higher computational complexity than other blocks of Ogg Vorbis decoding process. Based on computational cost analysis of whole decoding process, IMDCT (Inverse Modified Discrete Cosine Transform) is detected as the most computation-intensive functional block. As a result of FPGA (Field Programmable Gate Array) implementation, a 48% improvement in execution cycle is achieved by the specific hardware with 3,749 slices.",

The use of regular layouts can improve the printability of IC layouts, but it results in a significant area overhead by introducing regularity. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first approach that considers the tradeoff of cells with different levels of regularity and different area overheads during the logic synthesis, in order to improve overall design yield. A technology remapping tool with such yield model as cost function is proposed and implemented and interesting results are presented.",

    "abstract": "Evolvable hardware (EHW) is a new research field about the use of Evolutionary Algorithms (EAs) to construct electronic systems. EHW refers in a narrow sense to use evolutionary mechanisms as the algorithmic drivers for system design, while in a general sense to the capability of the hardware system to develop and to improve itself. Genetic Algorithm (GA) is one of typical EAs. We propose optimal circuit design by using GA with parameterized uniform crossover (GApuc) and with fitness function composed of circuit complexity, power, and signal delay. Parameterized uniform crossover is much more likely to distribute its disruptive trials in an unbiased manner over larger portions of the space, then it has more exploratory power than one and two-point crossover, so we have more chances of finding better solutions. Its effectiveness is shown by experiments. From the results, we can see that the best elite fitness, the average value of fitness of the correct circuits and the number of the correct circuits of GApuc are better than that of GA with one-point crossover or two-point crossover. The best case of optimal circuits generated by GApuc is 10.18% and 6.08% better in evaluating value than that by GA with one-point crossover and two-point crossover, respectively.",
